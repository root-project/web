In the second part of the ROOT Manual, numerous application areas and special topics of ROOT are presented.<br>
The [Trees]({{ '/manual/trees' | relative_url }}) chapter describes, how the data from LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiments are stored in trees and ROOT files.
In chapters like [Histograms]({{ '/manual/histograms' | relative_url }}), [Dataframes]({{ '/manual/data_frame' | relative_url }}), and [RooFit]({{ '/manual/roofit' | relative_url }}) is explained, how you can visualize and analyze the data with ROOT.

The second part of the ROOT Manual contains:

  - **[Histograms]({{ '/manual/histograms' | relative_url }})** <br>
    Histograms are approximate representations of the distribution of numerical data and they play a fundamental role in any kind of physical analysis.

  - **[Graphs]({{ '/manual/graphs' | relative_url }})** <br>
    A graph is an object made of two or three arrays X, Y and Z holding the x,y and z coordinates of n points.

  - **[Graphics]({{ '/manual/graphics' | relative_url }})** <br>
    ROOT provides powerful graphics capabilities for displaying and interacting with graphical object like plots, histograms, 2D and 3D graphical objects, etc.

  - **[Fitting]({{ '/manual/fitting' | relative_url }})** <br>
    Fitting is the method for modeling the expected distribution of events in a physics data analysis.

  - **[Dataframes]({{ '/manual/data_frame' | relative_url }})** <br>
    With RDataFrame, ROOT offers a modern, high-level interface for analysis of data stored in TTree s, CSV files and other data formats, in C++ or Python.

  - **[Trees]({{ '/manual/trees' | relative_url }})** <br>
    Trees can handle large columnar datasets.

  - **[RooFit]({{ '/manual/roofit' | relative_url }})** <br>
    ROOT provides with the RooFit library a toolkit for modeling the expected distribution of events in a physics analysis.

  - **[TMVA]({{ '/manual/tmva' | relative_url }})** <br>
    The Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT (TMVA) provides a machine learning environment for the processing and evaluation of multivariate classification.

  - **[Python interface: PyROOT]({{ '/manual/python' | relative_url }})** <br>
    With PyROOT, ROOT’s Python-C++ bindings, you can use ROOT from Python.

  - **[Mathematical libraries]({{ '/manual/math' | relative_url }})** <br>
    ROOT provides a rich set of mathematical libraries.

  - **[Physics vectors]({{ '/manual/physics_vectors' | relative_url }})** <br>
    ROOT provides several packes for physics vectors.

  - **[Geometry]({{ '/manual/geometry' | relative_url }})** <br>
    A geometry represents a Hierarchie of constructive solid geometry primitive elements (shapes or solid).

  - **[ROOT I/O]({{ '/manual/root_io' | relative_url }})** <br>
    A dictionary (“reflection database”) contains information about the types and functions that are available in a library.

  - **[Signal/Slot communication]({{ '/manual/signal_slot' | relative_url }})** <br>
    ROOT supports its own version of the signal/slot communication mechanism.

  - **[JSROOT]({{ '/manual/jsroot' | relative_url }})** <br>
    JavaScript ROOT (JSROOT) provides interactive graphics in the web browsers.

  - **[ How to embed ROOT in a GUI]({{ '/manual/embed_root_in_gui' | relative_url }})** <br>
