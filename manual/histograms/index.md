Histograms are approximate representations of the distribution of numerical data and they play a fundamental role in any kind of physical analysis.
Histograms can be used to visualize your data, by being an approximation to the underlying data density distribution, and they can be used also as a powerful form of data reduction. For a detailed
description of what is an histogram, see the corresponding page in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram).

ROOT provides a rich set of functionality to work with histograms. They can be used for continuos data in one or multi dimensions, they can represent integer data and they can also be used to display categorical data, such
as bar charts. Furthermore, ROOT supports building histograms from weighted data sets, which are very common in HEP, it provides the functionality to compute summary statistics information from the histograms input data, such as
sample mean, standard deviation and higher momenta.

ROOT provides also the functionality to perform operations on histograms such as addition, division and multiplication or transformations such as rebinning, scaling,
including normalisations, or projections from a multi dimensional histograms to ones with lower dimensions.
The ROOT histogram library provides also the capability or producing profile plots from multi dimensional data, see  [Profile Histograms](#profile-histograms).

The first step to construct an histogram is to define a range for the input data and then bin this range of values in intervals: the histogram bins.
The histogram will count how many values fall into each interval, building a frequency distribution of the input data.
ROOT supports histograms with bins of equal size or variable size.

See the histogram tutorials for all the possible type of histograms that can be built.

## Histogram classes

The ROOT histogram classes derive from the base {% include ref class="TH1" %}  class, which is a common interface to interact with the ROOT histograms.
Derived classes exist depending on the dimension, 1-D, 2-D and 3-D, and the type used to represent the bin contents:
- one byte per channel: `TH1C`, `TH2C` or `TH3C`. Maximum bin content = 127.
- one short per channel: `TH1S`, `TH2S` or `TH3S`. Maximum bin content = 32767.
- one int per channel: `TH1I`, `TH2I` or `TH3I`. Maximum bin content = 2147483647.
- one float per channel: `TH1F`, `TH2F` or `TH3F`. Maximum precision 7 digits, i.e a  maximum bin content of around 1E7 for having the precision of one count.
- one double per channel: `TH1D`, `TH2D` or `TH3D` . Maximum precision 15 digits, corresponding to a maximum bin content of around 5E15.

If there are no particular needs for limiting the memory used by the histograms, it is recommended to use the double precision version:
`TH1D` for the 1-D case, `TH2D` for the 2-D and `TH3D` for 3-D.

### Histograms for larger dimensions

For the case of dimensions larger than 3, ROOT provides a generic base class for multi-dimensional histogram {% include ref class="THn" %} and the derived classes
`THnD`, `THnF`, `THnL`, `THnI`, `THnS` and `THnC`, which are different instantiations of a generic template `THnT<Type>`.
The `THn` classes should be used when a large fraction of all bins are filled.
Given the large amount of memory used by `THn`, sparse multi-dimensional histogram classes exist for the use case of multi-dimensions and large number of bins.
The base class for sparse histograms is {% include ref class="THnSparse" %} with its derived instantiation `THnSparse<type>`.

Note that both `THn` and `THnSparse` do not inherit from `TH1` and have therefore a slightly different interface.


### Profile histograms

In addition to the standard histograms, ROOT provides also classes for producing profile plots, i.e plots obtained from multi-dimensional input data (e.g. X and Y), where one of the dimension
(Y) is not grouped in bins, but the sample mean value and the corresponding error are displayed. A profile plot can be used to better visualize dependence relations in multi-dimensional data, than using
standard multi-dimensional histogram plots such as scatter plots.

  - {% include ref class="TProfile" %} is a profile histogram for (X,Y) data to display the mean value of Y and its error for each bin in X.

  - {% include ref class="TProfile2D" %} is a profile histogram for (X,Y,Z) data to display the mean value of Z and its error for each cell in X,Y.

- {% include ref class="TProfile3D" %} is a profile histogram for (X,Y,Z,T) data to display the mean value of T and its error for each cell in X,Y,Z.

Profile plots have the option to display instead of the default sample mean error the sample standard deviation (the spread of the data). A similar plot to a profile, which shows the quantiles of the
Y input data, is the candle plot, called also box plot,  (see [tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/master/candleplot_8C.html)), which can be obtained directly from the 2D histogram using the `candle`
draw option.


### Bin numbering

All histogram types support fixed or variable bin sizes. 2-D histograms may have fixed size bins along X and variable size bins along Y or vice-versa.
The type of binning of the histogram is managed by the {% include ref class="TAxis" %} class, which defines also the minimum and maximum range of the input data that will be collected in the bins.
The `TH1` class orders the bins using a *global bin* number for dealing with the multi-dimensional cases.

**Conventions**

For all histogram types: `nbins`, `xlow`, `xup`:

  - bin# 0 contains the underflow.

  - bin# 1 contains the first bin with low-edge (`xlow` INCLUDED).

  - The second to last bin (bin# nbins) contains the upper-edge (`xup` EXCLUDED).

  - The last bin (bin# `nbins+1`) contains the overflow.

  - A *global bin* number is defined  to access the histogram bin information independently of the dimension.

Assuming a 3-D histogram `h` with `binx`, `biny`, `binz`, the function [TH1::GetBin(binx,biny,binz)](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a641262682144d465d7e2bc6101a04bf6) returns a global
bin number and given a global bin number `bin`, the function [TH1::GetBinXYZ(bin,binx,biny,binz)](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a55e591270aaad37c3059a62f83566e4e) computes the
corresponding `binx`, `biny` and `binz`.

More details on the histogram binning are available in the TH1 [reference documentation](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#binning).
ROOT supports also automatic binning, see [Histograms with automatic bins](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#auto-bin).


**Re-binning**

You can re-bin a histogram via the [TH1::Rebin()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aff6520fdae026334bf34fa1800946790){:target="_blank"} method. It returns a new histogram with the re-binned contents. If bin errors were stored, they are recomputed during the re-binning.
You can see this [tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/master/rebin_8C.html) as a re-binning example.

### Stack of histograms

{% include ref class="THStack" %} is a collection of {% include ref class="TH1" %} or {% include ref class="TH2" %} histograms. The tutorial {%include tutorial name="hstack" %} is a good example of how using the `THStack` class.

## Working with histograms


### Creating and copying a histogram

- Use a constructor of the derived classes (`TH1D` instead of `TH1`)  to create a histogram object, by passing in addition to name an title strings, the number of bins, the minimum and maximum range.

_**Examples**_

In the following examples, histograms are created for the classes {% include ref class="TH1I" %}, {% include ref class="TH2F" %}, {% include ref class="TH3D" %}:

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1* h1 = new TH1I("h1", "h1 title", 100, 0.0, 4.0);
   TH2* h2 = new TH2F("h2", "h2 title", 40, 0.0, 2.0, 30, -1.5, 3.5);
   TH3* h3 = new TH3D("h3", "h3 title");
{% endhighlight %}

For creating variable bins histograms:

{% highlight C++ %}
   double binEdges[] = { 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1., 2., 4. };
   TH1* h1 = new TH1D("h1", "h1 title", 6, binEdges );
   TH2* h2 = new TH2D("h2", "h2 title", 6, binEdges , 30, -1.5, 3.5);
{% endhighlight %}
note that the array of bin edges should be of size `nbins+1` , since it contains the lower and upper range axis values.

For creating a profile histograms passing the range in the profiled variable (e..g .Y for a `TProfille`) is optional:
{% highlight C++ %}
   TProfile* p1 = new TProfile("p1", "profile title", 40, 0.0, 2.0 );
   TProfile* p2 = new TProfile("p2", "profile title", 40, 0.0, 2.0, -1.5, 3.5 );
{% endhighlight %}


For Clone/copy an existing histogram you can use the `Clone()` method or the copy constructor.
Note that `Clone()` returns a pointer to a `TObject` and it requires the casting to `TH1`, while the copy constructor can be used only with the leaf histogram classes (e.g `TH1D` for a double type histogram).

_**Example**_

{% highlight C++ %}
TH1* hc = (TH1*)h1->Clone();
{% endhighlight %}
If the type of h1 is `TH1D` you can also do:
{% highlight C++ %}
TH1* hc = new TH1D(*h1);
{% endhighlight %}

#### Getting the bin width

- Use the [GetBinWidth()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#ad69a5fa0002361fd77f37990a29d1aa3){:target="_blank"} method to get the bin width of a histogram.

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1D h1("h1","Histogram from a Gaussian",100,-3,3);
   h1.GetBinWidth(1)

   (double) 0.060000000
{% endhighlight %}


### Filling a histogram

Fill a histogram with the [TH1::Fill()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a77e71290a82517d317ea8d05e96b6c4a){:target="_blank"} method.

_**Examples**_

- For 1-D histograms
{% highlight C++ %}
   h1->Fill(x);
   h1->Fill(x,w); // with weight
{% endhighlight %}
- For 2-D histograms and `TProfile`:
{% highlight C++ %}
   h2->Fill(x,y);
   p2->Fill(x,y);
   h2->Fill(x,y,w);  // with weights
   p2->Fill(x,y,w);
{% endhighlight %}
- For 3-D histograms and `TProfile2D`:
{% highlight C++ %}
   h3->Fill(x,y,z);
   h3->Fill(x,y,z,w); // with weights
{% endhighlight %}


The `Fill()` method computes the bin number corresponding to the given x, y or z argument and increments this bin by the given weight.<br>
The `Fill()` method returns the bin number for 1-D histograms or *global bin* number for 2-D and 3-D histograms.

Note that when filling an histogram passing a weight different than one, the histogram assumes you are dealing with a weighted data set and stores internally an additional array with the sum of weight square used to compute its error. A weighted histogram is displayed always by default showing the bin error for each bin instead of the standard histogram bar.
See [Filling histograms](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#filling-histograms) for more details about filling histograms, such as computation of bin errors or automatic axis extension.

#### Filling a histogram with vector input data


An histogram can also be filled directly by an array of values of type `double` and an array of weights.
{% highlight C++ %}
   std::vector<double> x = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
   std::vector<double> w(x.size(),1); // weights vector
   auto h1 = new TH1D("h1","h1 title",10,0.,10.);
   h1->FillN(10,x.data(),w.data());
{% endhighlight %}

This is useful when working in Python with `numpy` arrays, so you can fill directly an histograms. An example is provided in the next section.


#### Filling a histogram with random numbers

Fill a histogram with random numbers with the [TH1::FillRandom()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a1e9d6258ae798a0eb52aef58a72758a5){:target="_blank"} method.

The `FillRandom()` method uses the contents of an existing `TF1` function or another `TH1` histogram (for all dimensions) and the default random number generator defined in `gRandom`. See the  {%
include ref class="TRandom" %} class for the available generators in ROOT.

_**Example**_

A histogram is randomly filled 10 000 times with a default Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and sigma 1.

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1F h1("h1","Histogram from a Gaussian",100,-3,3);
   h1.FillRandom("gaus",10000);
{% endhighlight %}

In Python you can use random numbers generated using the `numpy.random` library and `FillN` for filling the histogram:

```python
   import numpy as np
   import ROOT
#generate an array of normal distributed data with mean=5 and stddev=2 containing 1000 values
   x = np.random.normal(5,2,1000)
   w = np.ones(1000)
   h1 = ROOT.TH1D("h1","h1 title",50,0.,10.);
   h1.FillN(1000, x, w)
```

Use the [TH1::GetRandom()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a4dd1bbf1cbeea1e7da03e781d01cf232){:target="_blank"} method to get a random number distributed according the contents of a histogram.

### Adding, multiplying and dividing histograms

Following operations are supported on histograms or between histograms:

-   Addition of a histogram to the current histogram.

-   Additions of two histograms with coefficients and storage into the current histogram.

-   Multiplications and divisions are supported in the same way as additions.

You can use the operators (+, *, /) or the {% include ref class="TH1" %} methods `Add()`, `Multiply()` and `Divide()`.

_**Examples**_

Multiplying a histogram object with a constant:

{% highlight C++ %}
   h1.Scale(const)
{% endhighlight %}

Creating a new histogram without changing the original one:

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1F h3 = 8*h1;
{% endhighlight %}

Multiplying two histograms and put the result in the third one:

{% highlight C++ %}
TH1F h3 = h1*h2;
{% endhighlight %}

When performing operations, the resulting bin errors and histogram statistics are computed assuming the two histograms are independents and a normal approximation for the bin error is used.
A special case is when histograms are divided to compute efficiency and in this case the numerator histogram is a subset of the denominator histogram. The correct handling of errors is done by using
the {% include ref class="TEfficiency" %} class.

### Normalizing histograms

You can use [TH1::Scale (Double_t c1 = 1, Option_t* option = “”)](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#add929909dcb3745f6a52e9ae0860bfbd){:target="_blank"} in combination with [TH1::Integral (Option_t* option = “”)](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aaf053a4b487c46b9e20c0bf534b34012){:target="_blank"} to normalize histograms.

The following example shows how to normalize a histograms, such as it represents a probability density distribution

_**Example**_

The following histogram is given:

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1D *h = new TH1D("h","a trial histogram", 100, -1.5, 1.5);
   for (Int_t i = 0; i < 10000; i++) h->Fill(gRandom->Gaus(0, 1));
   h->Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

{% include figure_image
   img="histo-trial.png"
   caption="A trial histogram for normalizing."
%}

To use the normalization methods, you can clone first the histogram to keep the original one, call then `TH1::Scale` passing as scale parameter value the histogram integral. In addition, use the option `width` to divide also by the bin width in order to display the probability density in each bin.
If you want to show just the frequency probability of each bin, you don't need to use the `width` option.

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1*h1 = (TH1*)(h->Clone("h1"));
   h1->Scale(1./h1->Integral(), "width");
   h1->Draw();
{% endhighlight %}


After applying the normalization method, redraw the histogram with your preferred [drawing option](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01):

{% highlight C++ %}
   myHist->Draw("HIST")
{% endhighlight %}



## Drawing a histogram

- Use the [TH1::Draw()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aa53a024a9e94d5ec91e3ef49e49563da){:target="_blank"} method to draw a histogram using the provided drawing option.
    The drawing is delegated to the {% include ref class="THistPainter" %} class that specializes the drawing of the histogram. The {% include ref class="THistPainter" %} class is separated
    from the histogram, so that the histogram class does not contain the graphics overhead.

### Drawing options

The "drawing option" is the unique parameter of the [TH1::Draw()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aa53a024a9e94d5ec91e3ef49e49563da){:target="_blank"}
method. It specifies how the histogram will be graphically rendered.
For detailed information on the drawing options for all histogram classes, refer to
[THistPainter](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01a){:target="_blank"}.
For all possible available options see the [Histogram plotting options](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01).

> **Note**
>
> The drawing options are *NOT* case sensitive!

### Drawing an histogram copy

By default when an histogram is drawn in the ROOT canvas it is not copied in order to have automatically draw updates that can happen in the histogram object.
This means that if the histogram object is created on the stack inside a defined C++ scope (or inside a Python function when using PyROOT), it will be automatically deleted when exiting the scope and
the final consequence will be that the drawn object will disappear. To avoid this to happen you can use:

  - [TH1::DrawCopy()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aa19b24b96284284d677cd73f00d29d79){:target="_blank"} or [TObject::DrawClone()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTObject.html#a7cd0f76ae1791c469f9472a9d4c8d6f9) methods to create a copy of the histogram when drawing it.

_**Examples**_

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1D h1("h1","Histogram from a Gaussian",100,-3,3);
   h1.FillRandom("gaus",10000);
   h1.Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

{% include figure_jsroot
   file="histograms.root" object="h1" width="500px" height="350px"
   caption="Histogram drawn with Draw()."
   %}

- draw an histogram with error bars:

{% highlight C++ %}
   h1.Draw("E");
{% endhighlight %}

- draw a 2-D histogram as a LEGO plot:
{% highlight C++ %}
{
   TH2D h2("h2","Histogram filled with random numbers",40,-4,4,40,-20,20);
   float px, py;
   for (int i = 0; i < 25000; i++) {
      gRandom->Rannor(px,py);
      h2.Fill(px,5*py);
   }
   h2.DrawCopy("LEGO1");
{% endhighlight %}
Note that we have used here `DrawCopy` since in this case the histogram is created within a C++ scope and it will be deleted at the end.

{% include figure_image
   img="histo-lego.png"
   caption="Histogram drawn with Draw(\"LEGO1\")."
%}



{% include ref class="THistPainter" %} implements drawing options for
 [1-D](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01b){:target="_blank"},
 [2-D](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01c){:target="_blank"}, and
 [3-D](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01d){:target="_blank"} histogram classes.
It also implements specific drawing options for
 [THStack](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP01e){:target="_blank"}.


### Using the histogram Editor

The following example shows how to use the GUI Editor to modify the histogram drawing

_**Example**_

{% highlight C++ %}
   TH1F h1("h1","Histogram from a Gaussian",100,-3,3);
   h1.FillRandom("gaus",10000);
   h1.Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

A canvas with the histogram is displayed.

- Click `View`, and then click `Editor`.

- Click on the histogram.

In the `Style` tab, you can select and change some of the drawing option and drawing style.


## Fitting Histograms

Histograms in ROOT can be fitted with user defined functions defined using the ROOT  {% include ref class="TF1" %} function classes.
For fitting histograms see the [Fitting section]({{ '/manual/fitting' | relative_url }}).

## Miscellaneous Operations

### Projections of histograms

One can perform projection from multi-dimensional histograms (`TH2` and `TH3`) to lower dimensional histograms and to profile histograms (`TProfile`). See the
[reference guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#prof-hist) for the available projection functions.


### Fast Fourier transforms for histograms

ROOT provides with {% include ref class="TVirtualFFT" %} an interface class for fast Fourier transforms (FFT) (see → [FFTW]({{ '/manual/math/#fftw' | relative_url }}). With [TH1::FFT()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a69321e3106e4a26db3fef4d126d835ff){:target="_blank"} you can perform a FFT for a histogram.

## Histogram statistics

ROOT histograms provide functions to compute statistics on the input data such as mean, [TH1::GetMean](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a3e2fa7eca22330a7f6458e481e6ca0ae), standard
deviation, [TH1::GetStdDev](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a31a19244776aca64aab4ee1808f14c32)and also  kurtosis,
[TH1::GetKurtosis](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aff8626d5a150eab4a19bbbc258718c5d) and skewness,
[TH1::GetSkewness](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a3f2e05cf408b6e69602141e6699883c5)and covariance and correlation, see for example [TH2::GetCorrelationFactor](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH2.html#a0a319442275deed3941c0904cecddd3c) for multi-dimensional
histograms.

The function `TH1::GetRMS` is equivalent to `TH1::GetStdDev`, since historically the `RMS` has been identified as the sample standard deviation.

In addition, ROOT provides functions to compute estimations of  the error of the sample mean and standard deviations.
See [TH1::GetMeanError](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aa4e6882403221cd5e38cd0716295e751) and
[TH1::GetStdDevError](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#ae7b4359f7eee88b7a21468308bc365aa).

The histogram statistics can be displayed in the histogram statistics box.

Note that by default, the histogram statistics are computed on all the raw input data sample, but when an histogram range is selected, the statistics are computed in the user defined range and using only the
bin center information.

The function [TH1::GetQuantiles] computes, from the given histogram binned data, the quantiles, such as  median and quartiles.
For example, to compute the quartiles (including the median), you provide as input the probability values for which you want to compute the corresponding quantiles:

{% highlight C++ %}
   double p[3] = { 0.25, 0.50, 0.75};
   double q[3];
   h1.GetQuantiles(3,q,p);
   std::cout << "first quartile (25th percentile) = " << q[0] << std::endl;
   std::cout << "median (50th percentile) = " << q[1] << std::endl;
   std::cout << "third quartile (75th percentile) = " << q[2] << std::endl;
{% endhighlight %}


### Statistical tests

The ROOT histogram class provides also functions to perform statistical comparison tests, such as goodness of fit tests, for testing compatibility of two histograms (2 sample tests) or compatibility
of an histogram with a theoretical distribution, i.e. a function (1 sample tests).

For tests of histogram-histogram compatibility:
- [TH1::Chi2Test](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#a6c281eebc0c0a848e7a0d620425090a5) for performing a chi2 test between two histograms. This tests works also for multi-dimensional
  histograms, but it requires to have non-empty bins.
- [TH1::KolmogorovTest](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aeadcf087afe6ba203bcde124cfabbee4) to perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the two histograms. Note that this tests works only for
  1-D histograms and it has a
  bias for binned data and should be used if the bin size is sufficiently small.
- [TH1::AndersonDarlig](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#aa395c473ea9693359a74189fbe0ee0db) working only for 1-D histograms.

For histogram-function comparison tests:
- [TH1::Chisquare](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#ab78967d8b3ede39791a2ec4b20afbb84) using the chi2 test
-  [TH1::Chisquare(function,"L")](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTH1.html#ab78967d8b3ede39791a2ec4b20afbb84) (note the option `L`) to use the Poisson likelihood ratio based method suggested by Baker
and Cousins (see corresponding [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167508784900164)).

### Histogram bin Errors

The bin error of the histograms are computed by default as following:
-  unweighted histogram: square root of bin content
-  weighted histogram : square root of the bin sum of the weights square.

For unweighted histograms there is also the option to compute the Poisson standard confidence intervals for each bin, by calling `TH1::SetBinErrorOption(TH1::kPoisson)`. After this, one can retrieve
the corresponding lower and upper bin error by using `TH1::GetBinErrorLow()` and `TH1::GetBinErrorUp`.
