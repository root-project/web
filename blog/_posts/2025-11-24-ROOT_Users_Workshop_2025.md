What a week! 
Last week the [13th ROOT Users Workshop](https://cern.ch/root2025) took place in Valencia, Spain, at the Universitad Politecnica de Valencia (UPV).

More than 80 scientists and students from institutes in 16 countries convened together to discuss ROOT and shape its future. The programme consisted of a number of contributions - 56 talks, 19 posters, 1 training, 1 VR booth - making it an innovative agenda, padded with generous discussion slots. We subdivided the week in four tracks: experiments and large initiatives presentations, data analysis, statistical inference and language interoperability.
Of course, [LHC experiments were present](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/sessions/588473/#20251117), however, we also had great talks by other large communities such as [Belle II](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6782093/), [BES III](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6706603/), [Gravitational Waves](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6706597/) or [Future Linear Collider](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6706607/). The event was not even only about particle physics: we enjoyed presentations about [compiler technology](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6779508/), [finance](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6728231/) and [medical physics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6706598/).

The workshop was a very rewarding experience for the ROOT Project, and we are thankful to all the participants for making it a success. Stay tuned for the next one 😉😉!
