If you've ever rubbed your eyes trying to decrypt *C++* compilation errors from a terminal, or even have faced with your bare eye the intimidating logs of valgrind output for memory leak detection, or manually deployed *gdb*, you should definitely keep reading. With this post, I believe you'll improve your productivity and experience with *ROOT* by using QtCreator as a development and troubleshooting environment.

## Errors are development tools, not silly mistakes

There is a natural tendency to look at compilation or conceptual errors as unwanted accidents or mistakes that only happen rarely, because of my own inexperience, and that surely will not happen next time. As such, we are not explicitly prepared nor trained to deal with them systematically. We just tackle them as a contingency and try to solve them quickly with whatever tools at hand. Yet experience tells us that errors (in programming, in mathematics, in [judgement biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)) are not an exception, but rather the rule.

In fact, most of the time in (robust) development is spent on debugging and troubleshooting, either passively by looking at whatever problem pops up, or actively, by creating robust software architecture from its conception that prevents them (via strong-typing, smart pointers, ordered structure and abstraction, good documentation, ...), as well as a suite of tests that prevent these in the future in as many virtual scenarios as possible. It is not uncommon that you may write an analysis software in 5 hours, but then spend 5 days tracking down why the heck it's giving wrong results, or crashing once every 100 times, or even more worryingly, leading you silently to wrong scientific conclusions or errors in other links of your analysis chain, that are far away from its original source and thus hard to trace back.

Yet, despite knowing the forefront impact on your workflow and scientific robustness, many of us physicist are not trained to deal with errors with the proper tools, and we still deploy inefficient and manual ways to hack them "as quickly as possible", hoping (with uncertainty and fear) that they "won't come back". Because we will encounter errors much more frequently than we might think at first place, it makes sense to invest some "initial setup time" to create a robust platform for tackling and fixing these in a systematic way. Rather than reacting with insecurity to these or keeping them in the back of the mind as a passive or transient threat/accident, let's assume they will be rather the norm and an important key player in our development, a learning tool that will appear continuously and is worth optimizing. In the same way that one does no longer use a pen if one wants to send 10000 letters, compared to only 10. In this situation, it's interesting to partly shift your paradigm from "troubleshooting your code", to "code for troubleshooting", i.e. develop the instruments to quickly detect the mistakes you will surely make.

### IDEs to the rescue
Integrated Desktop Environment (IDE) softwares are very powerful tools to detect errors (thanks e.g. to [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)), trace them back to the right point in the source code, and even automatically suggest the solution. *ROOT* scripts, as well as standalone *C++* programs relying on *ROOT* libraries, can be integrated with minimum effort into these IDEs. Examples on the steps to follow are nicely explained in older blog posts for the [Visual Studio](https://root.cern/blog/root-on-vscode/) and [Eclipse](https://root.cern/blog/debuging-root-scripts-in-eclipse/) IDEs, as well as in the [Twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/BristolEclipseTutorial) and [other blogs](
https://petrstepanov.wordpress.com/2015/11/15/compile-cern-root-program-with-roofit-in-eclipse/). In this post, I will focus on a third option, the open-source [QtCreator IDE](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source).

## QtCreator

While optimized for *Qt* applications, *QtCreator* is totally generic, [open-source](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source), and it can compile and run any *C++* program, *CMake* project, *Makefile*, etc. You don't even need to know what *Qt* means. You don't need to use *qmake* nor native *Qt* project files either (in fact, I prefer to always use *CMake* to get rid of any dependence with *Qt*). Your project will be equally compilable from a terminal with *Make* / *CMake* than via *QtCreator*, which just acts as a non-invasive interface.

### Installation steps

You can find (usually) outdated versions of *QtCreator* in your package manager, but I recommend to use the [online installer](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source), which then periodically checks for updates at program start. If you prefer not to open a user account with them, you can use the [offline installer](https://www.qt.io/offline-installers/?hsLang=en). While installing, I recommend to deactivate all *Qt* library options, newer *CMake* versions or *Ninja*. You will just need *QtCreator*.

### Select your compiler Kit

Go to "Tools", "Options", "Kits". Click for example on one of the auto-detected kits in the dialog. You can define your custom one, which will appear as "Manual" in the tree view. I recommend setting up a "Manual" kit, where "Qt version" is set to "None" (in case it was set), and in "CMake generator", "Ninja" is changed to "Unix Makefiles" (if you are not in Windows). If you prefer to use the "Ninja" generator, make sure that it is installed in your system. Finally, click "Ok".

Beware: in OSx, the "Tools", "Options" menu is instead under "AppName", "Preferences".

### Open a C++ CMake project

You can open any *CMake* project you have on your computer by clicking on "File", "Open File or Project". Find then the main folder where your project's source code is located. Usually, there will be a "CMakeLists.txt" file in the main directory. Double-click then on this one, rather than in any other "CMakeLists.txt" that might appear in the subdirectories of this same project. If you prefer the command line, you can run directly as `qtcreator my/folder/CMakeLists.txt &`. If you installed *QtCreator* in a local folder, you might need to run something like: `/opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator my/folder/CMakeLists.txt &`.

If you rather use *Makefiles*, that's also supported via the [Import](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-generic.html#importing-a-generic-project) menu, by clicking on "File", "New File or Project", "Import Project", "Import Existing Project", "Choose", and then select the source files you want to see in your tree (or just click on select all and deactivate those that are images, etc.). The *Makefile* will be automatically detected behind the scenes. You can edit the number of threads (`-j`) later on the project's "Build settings".

Let me load into *QtCreator* the [simplest CMake example](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/A%20Basic%20Starting%20Point.html). After "Open File or Project", a "Kit dialog" will apear. The button "Manage Kits" on the top left allows you to remember what compiler was associated with each kit (as explained [above](#select-your-compiler-kit)), click "Ok" to close. Select the "build kit" you prefer, and then click on "Details". There, you can specify in what folder to build your program. Under "Tools", "Options", "Build", "Default Properties" allows you to setup a default directory for your builds.

Once you click on "Configure Project", *CMake* will be automatically run. In the "Projects" pane, you can tune any *CMake* flag as needed, as well as specify command line arguments when running. The "Build" hammer icon on the left compiles your project (*make*), and the "Run" play icon executes it.

You will not need to re-do all these configuration steps later on for this project, as *QtCreator* will store these settings in a file called "CMakeLists.txt.user" and recognize it automatically the next time you open the project.

### The Power of <kbd>F1</kbd>

Let's assume now that you have forgotten what class `std::cout` corresponds to. Luckily, *Qt* has an in-built (offline) help support system. For a first-time configuration, you will just need to download the "Help Book" of your library, in this case the `std` library from [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Cppreference:Archives#Qt_help_book) or via your package manager (`sudo apt install cppreference-doc-en-qch`). Then, in "Tools", "Options", "Help", "Documentation", you can add the downloaded (or `/usr/share/` installed) ".qch" file.

Once this is set, you can either <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+Click on your function or object to immediately go to the source code definition (file will open in another tab), or press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and the HTML documentation will appear on your right side without having to type / search anything online.

[![Example of F1 with C++](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155714549-9f451b59-23d8-4640-a223-6137d8840f41.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155714549-9f451b59-23d8-4640-a223-6137d8840f41.png)

If you use and compile *LLVM* yourself, you can also get your *Qt Help* file [as described here](https://reviews.llvm.org/D2967).

The ROOT framework also has a ".qch" *Help Book* available [for download](https://root.cern/reference/), thus you'll be able to quickly consult any documentation using the <kbd>F1</kbd> key, rather than searching online, which can be useful in case you are traveling and have no Internet access.

[![Example of F1 with ROOT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154870916-28e4009d-eb70-46df-a52b-da81cfe3c97f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154870916-28e4009d-eb70-46df-a52b-da81cfe3c97f.png)

You can not only check the documentation with <kbd>F1</kbd>, but fully open the *HTML* reference guide by clicking on the big "Help" icon (left pane), as shown below.

[![ROOT Help Book](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154870717-6f0ffdf4-084b-45d6-92d3-dc2a948f27b5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154870717-6f0ffdf4-084b-45d6-92d3-dc2a948f27b5.png)

Alternatively, you can also open the *Help Books* and search them using [Qt Assistant](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/assistant-details.html). Linux *apt* packages are `qt4-dev-tools` or `qt5-assistant`, and the executables are `assistant-qt4` and `assistant`, respectively. (`qt6` version is not yet in the package manager.) You will have to add the `.qch` file to its database by going to "Edit", "Preferences", "Documentation", "Add".

And if you already use other IDEs or operating systems ? In addition to [inline HTML searching](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/searching.html), the building of the (*ROOT*) doxygen documentation can be configured to output a format that is compatible with *MacOS* - [Xcode](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html#cfg_generate_docset), *Windows* - [VSstudio](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html#cfg_generate_htmlhelp), or [Eclipse](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html#cfg_generate_eclipsehelp). *ROOT* [only provides for download](https://root.cern/reference/) the *Qt* help files (`.qch`) for the moment, but you can [build the documentation yourself](https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/) adapting those flags in the *Doxyfile*.

### The Power of Clang

Grown over many years and standards, larger software projects have plenty of legacy code that is not as safe as the one someone would write today. Unsurprisingly, there are still some bugs here and there, and instabilities that haven't been solved. Some of these bugs and potential style improvements can be detected thanks to the *Clang-analyzer*, which performs code analysis based on configurable settings.

*QtCreator* bundles perfectly with *Clang-Analyzer*, see left pane, "Debug" icon, then "Debugger" dropdown menu, "Clang-Tidy and Clazy". It parses its output warnings and takes you directly to where the code needs to be changed.
In addition, it even lets you apply "fixits" by a mouse-click: if *Clang* knows how to correct the problem, he will change the code automatically for you.

To give an example, analyzing the `core` of *ROOT* yields several diagnostics, and this can be quite useful for tracing in case you are seeing some memory leak when your application is deploying *ROOT* libraries:

[![Clang-Tidy example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/153959440-a2fb89c8-3459-49ae-9248-37283fefeb9a.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/153959440-a2fb89c8-3459-49ae-9248-37283fefeb9a.png)

If, for example, you would like to modernize your code syntax to the latest *C++* standard, you can configure the *Clang* settings in "Tools", "Analyzer", "Default checks", and enable the `modernize-` option. For example, with a single click, you can change `NULL` to `nullptr` across your whole codebase.

### Formatting your code

Whether you like 4 spaces, 2 spaces, 1 tab, braces in the beginning or in the end... it does not matter what your taste is. What's important is that you do not spend your valuable time on formatting things by hand. *QtCreator* can be helpful in this regard, too, if you activate the [Beautifier plugin](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html) as well as install `clang-format`.

For example, let's suppose you want to submit a pull request of one of your functions to *ROOT*, which has its own formatting guidelines. The easiest is to copy to your project the `.clang-format` configuration file from the [repository](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format) or the [website](https://root.cern/contribute/coding_conventions/#using-clangformat-or-astyle-in-your-preferred-editor) and then go to "Tools", "Options", "Beautifier", "Clang Format", and specify the file location. (Or if you are building ROOT itself using *QtCreator*, specify "File" in the dropdown menu, and it will auto-detect the one in the source tree).

You can also define a [keyboard shortcut](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-keyboard-shortcuts.html) to format the file, by going to "Tools", "Environment", "Keyboard", search for "format" and assign e.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.

Once that is configured, you can enable to auto-format your file when saving, or apply changes manually via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. Here a snippet before and after applying it:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
```
```cpp
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
```

### git version control
For one of your projects, or even for the *ROOT* codebase, you might be using *git* for version control. *QtCreator* integrates seamlessly with the typical *git* commands, and can show you a visual *diff* of the current changes, as well as `commit` (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) and `push` your changes using its graphical interface, or `pull` the latest version from the remote repository.

[![Git dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154095599-849e5dcf-79a1-4b80-a44d-8ff35506e068.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154095599-849e5dcf-79a1-4b80-a44d-8ff35506e068.png)

### Why bother with QtCreator when I am pro with emacs and vim?

You can get the best of both worlds by using the [FakeVim mode](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-editor-fakevim.html) or the [emacs plugin](https://machinekoder.com/running-qt-creator-in-emacs-mode/). Just give it a try ;)

And if you just need column-editing, you don't need any of those, QtCreator supports that [natively](https://forum.qt.io/topic/46348/qt-creator-column-edit).

### CTests

If you've built *ROOT* enabling the "testing" *CMake* flag, or if your project contains "CTests", "Boost Tests", etc. for ensuring that new changes you apply don't break older functionality, *QtCreator* has a platform to visually run and check the results of all those tests. No need to scroll in a terminal to find which one failed.

Beware:

- Go first to "Tools", "Options", "Testing", "General", and adapt the total "Timeout" to allow running all tests at once.
- Be sure that the option "CTest" is active under "Active Frameworks" of that same menu.

[![CTest dialog example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154115506-96c9c1da-ca66-4dbc-87cf-47c1c60ef215.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/154115506-96c9c1da-ca66-4dbc-87cf-47c1c60ef215.png)

### To gild the lily

QtCreator lets you not only find compilation errors, but also documentation errors, by interfacing with the warnings issued by *doxygen*. This metawarning function can prove extremely useful for detecting outdated or incorrect documentation and going to the right spot in the source code in just one click, rather than diving through [thousands of lines of output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/view/ROOT/job/root-makedoc-master/lastBuild/consoleText) and tracing it manually.

To give it a try, take a look at building the [ROOT documentation project](https://root.cern/for_developers/doxygen/). Follow these steps:

- Call first `source /path/to/ROOT/bin/thisroot.sh` in the terminal and launch `qtcreator` from there. Alternatively, you can manually specify all the variables in the "Build" environment.
- Import the *Makefile* located in `root/documentation/doxygen` into *QtCreator*, as explained [above](#open-a-c-cmake-project)
- Click then on the "Build" icon.
 
Below a screenshot of the errors and the points in the source code found by just clicking on those issues.

[![Doxygen warnings visualized with QtCreator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155034554-ca488395-8c6d-4635-ba66-a70c06a262cd.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155034554-ca488395-8c6d-4635-ba66-a70c06a262cd.png)

I'd suggest you to define a custom output parser to catch some doxygen warnings of "potential candidates" when there is an ambiguous matching in the signatures. To do this, go to "Tools", "Options", "Build&Run", "Custom Output Parsers", "Add", and in "Warning", specify the pattern `(.*) at line (\d+) of file (.*)` and order 3,2,1. "Apply", "Ok", and in the "Projects", "Build Settings", on the bottom, click on activate the newly defined "Parser".

If you want even more verbose warnings about undocumented parameters, try setting `WARN_NO_PARAMDOC` to `YES` in the *Doxyfile* and `EXTRACT_ALL` to `NO`. This will account for many much more weak points of your documentation and let you pinpoint your efforts on the right spot. And while it can be burdensome to write all this extra missing documentation, *QtCreator* also simplifies the task by typing three magic characters on top a function. Then, it will [autocomplete all the skeleton](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17955686/using-automatic-documentation-of-my-own-function-with-qt-creator) in *doxygen* format. Check first if "Tools", "Text editor", "Completion", "Enable Doxygen blocks" is enabled.

Consider also enabling [this spell-checking plugin](https://github.com/CJCombrink/SpellChecker-Plugin) for detecting typos in your documentation. This can be done by simply downloading the release file and unzipping into into your qtcreator folder. Then, under "Tools", "Options", "Spellchecker", you can configure which dictionary or language(s) to use.

[![ROOT source code in the QtCreator IDE with Spell-check activated as well as Git management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155712333-f3fa1748-0a58-46ef-ad54-0f9b54c59fd4.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155712333-f3fa1748-0a58-46ef-ad54-0f9b54c59fd4.png)

## Debugging tools

If you need to debug your *ROOT* scripts, or the *ROOT* library itself, I recommend building *ROOT* [from its sources](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/), but using the "Debug" flag.

### Building ROOT in Debug Mode

To do this:

- Clone the *ROOT* *git* repository
- Open *QtCreator*
- "File", "Open File or Project" and double click on the main "CMakeLists.txt" file.
- In the "Configure Project" dialog that will appear, you will be prompted to select which kit (compiler) you want to use for building.
- On the top left, you can click on "Manage Kits" to remember your different compiler choices. (See the kit configuration [above](#select-your-compiler-kit)).  Click "Ok" to close.
- Click on the "checkbox" of the kit of choice for this build.
- Click then on "Details". Activate the "Debug", deactivate "Release". The "Debug" mode will internally set the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug`, as you would do from a command line.
- Specify also the folder where it will be built if you do not like the default choice. This can be set in the text box right from the "Debug" checkbox (while you are in the "Configure Project" - "your chosen Kit" dialog, "Details" dropdown unfolded).
- If you've already built *ROOT* using debug mode via your command line, then you can "import" your preexisting build, to not recompile it and save your time.
- Press then on the "Configure Project" button.
- On the left pane, press again on the "Projects" icon.
- At the bottom of the "Key" tree viewer, deactivate or activate submodules of *ROOT* as needed. This acts as passing `-Dmodule=ON` via the command line.
- Consider enabling "testing" to run all *ROOT* tests.
- In the "Build steps" section, click on "Details", and specify `-j8` on the "CMake arguments" or whatever other number, to speed up the build.
- On the left bottom pane, click on the "Build" (the big hammer) icon, and *ROOT* will be compiled.
- Once built, on the left, click on "Projects", click on "your-Kit-name" on the left, under "Build & Run", then on the "Run" small icon just below it, and under "Run configuration" on the right, select from the dropdown which executable you want to run. (The one selected by default might be "FileCheck", click on it to change it).
- Under "Command line arguments", specify what arguments you want to pass to this executable.
- Specify also the "Working directory".
- If needed, activate the "Run in terminal" checkbox.
- You can then run it from the big "Play" icon on the left pane.

### Debugging your ROOT scripts or executables with GDB

To debug your script, on the "Projects", "Build & Run", "Your-Kit-Name, "Run" settings, specify your executable right of "Run configuration" by clicking on the dropdown menu (your own standalone application, or `root.exe`) and specify your "Command line arguments", e.g. `-l -b` as well as "Working directory", e.g. the name of the script you want to run as well as their parameters. If you want to precompile instead of interpret with cling, consider using the debug flag `g` when passing the command line argument (`yourScript.C+g`)

Click then on the "Play-Bug" icon on the left, and your script will run in "Debug" mode. Breakpoints can be set interactively on your code. <kbd>F5</kbd> will pause or resume your process, as well as show you a workspace of the active variables and threads. For example, specify as "Command line arguments" `-l -b hsimple.C+ -q` and as working directory `your-root-folder/tutorials`. Open this file within QtCreator, and click on the left of the line numbers, and then click on the "Play-Bug" icon on the left, the script will execute and pause when it reaches that point. You can then perform step-by-step execution using the three little arrow icons right from the "Debugger" dropdown menu. You can hover your mouse over them and a tooltip will show their function.

Below a screenshot of another example, while debugging [a deadlock in the TThread class](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8365).

[![Debugging example with QtCreator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155715232-c86cfd3d-2153-454f-a948-ccd9a8595363.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/155715232-c86cfd3d-2153-454f-a948-ccd9a8595363.png)

Side note: if at some point, your *ROOT* script gets very complex long, I recommend instead to use a standalone *C++* application using *CMake*, and link the *ROOT* libraries easily to it, as explained [here](https://root.cern/manual/integrate_root_into_my_cmake_project/#full-example-event-project).

### Memory error detection

To check for memory leaks and corruption, *QtCreator* offers a seamless integration with valgrind (or [heob on Windows](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-analyzer.html)), making the backtrace of your errors fully interactive. To run it, press on the big "Debug button" on the left. Then, on the dropdown menu, change from "Debugger" to "Memcheck" and click on the small play button.

If you need extra arguments for *valgrind*, you will need to specify those under "Tools", "Options", "Analyzer", "Valgrind".
There, I also recommend to click on "Add", "etc/valgrind-root.supp" from your cloned repository, to suppress spurious warnings.

The resulting warnings can be easily clicked to bring you to the right spot in your code, or in the *ROOT* codebase, where the issue is arising from.

[![Valgrind example with QtCreator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/124675469-04769e80-debd-11eb-95d0-595f613c4689.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10653970/124675469-04769e80-debd-11eb-95d0-595f613c4689.png)

Often, you will also find helpful to run the static *Clang-analyzer*, which is able to detect many unsafe parts of your code that might be leading to memory leaks. It's in the same dropdown menu, under "Clang-Tidy and Clazy".

### Data race detection

First, I recommend to click on "Tools", "Options", "Analyzer", "Valgrind", "Add", "etc/valgrind-root.supp" from your *git* repository. Then, on the dropdown menu, change from "Debugger" to "Memcheck" and click on the small play button.

*Helgrind* cannot be run yet directly from QtCreator. The workaround is to run `root.exe` or your own executable from your command line, with the flags `--tool=helgrind --xml=yes --xml-file=yourfile.xml`. Then, you can "load" the result using the small "open" button right from the dropdown menu. The parsing tool works great and takes you the relevant location in your code.

### Performance analysis

In case you want to optimize the [performance of your code](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-cache-profiler.html), you can select from the debugger dropdown menu between "Callgrind" or the [Performance Analyzer](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-cpu-usage-analyzer.html). If you install and use `callgrind`, consider installing also `kcachegrind` for visualization.

### Other approaches

There are other tricks to boost your development in a way that's integrated with your IDE. For example:

- If you use a standalone application that uses *ROOT* libraries and graphical interface, but not it's terminal, you might want to check the [TGCommandPlugin](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGCommandPlugin.html) window. With it, you can nicely interact with your internal *C++* classes while your program is executing, without having to build in "Debug" mode, which has sometimes downsides due to its slow performance. To make *ROOT* aware of your *C++* object, you need to call within your program:
gROOT->ProcessLine(
      static_cast<TString>(
          "MyClassType* const fMyInstance = reinterpret_cast<MyClasstype*>(") +
      static_cast<std::ostringstream &>(std::ostringstream("") << fMyInstance)
          .str() +
      ");");
And then, of course, creating a `TGCommandPlugin` window. From there, typing `fMyInstance->MyMethod()` will execute binary code interactively.

- [This VS Studio plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=albertopdrf.root-file-viewer) allows for a nice integration of a *ROOT* file browser. Maybe it will come [at some point](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/rbrowser-plugin-for-qtcreator/48807) for *QtCreator*, too.

- Interfaces between [Cling and Qt](https://github.com/herrgahr/qling) have been attempted before.

## Quick recipe Summary

- Optional: install `valgrind`, `callgrind`, `kcachegrind`.
- [Install QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) deactivating all extra options.
- Download *std Help Book* from [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/Cppreference:Archives#Qt_help_book) or package manager (`sudo apt install cppreference-doc-en-qch`).
- Download [ROOT Help Book](https://root.cern/reference/).
- Add both ".qch" files via "Tools", "Options", "Help", "Documentation".
- "Tools", "Options", "Analyzer", "Default checks", configure as needed.
- Install the [Beautifier plugin](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html), potentially download the [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format) one to store in your own project.
- "Tools", "Options", "Beautifier", "Clang", "Use predefined style", "File"
- If you enable "testing" flag in *CMake*, adapt "Timeout" in "Tools", "Options", "Testing".
- Be sure that the option "CTest" is active under "Active Frameworks" of that same menu.
- Optional: Check that "Tools", "Kits", you have selected the compiler you want, as well as "CMake generator". If you use *Ninja*, make sure it's installed.
- Optional: Check that "Tools", "Text editor", "Completion", "Enable Doxygen blocks" is enabled.
- Optional: Under "Tools", "Options", "Build & Run", "Custom Output Parsers", "Add", "Warning", specify the pattern `(.*) at line (\d+) of file (.*)` and order 3,2,1. "Apply", "Ok". Activate it under "Projects", "Build Settings", on the bottom.
- Optional: Install [a spellchecker plugin](https://github.com/CJCombrink/SpellChecker-Plugin) by unzipping the release file into your *QtCreator* installation folder. Configure then your dictionary under "Tools", "Options", "Spellchecker".
- Clone the [ROOT git repository](https://github.com/root-project/root/) and open main "CMakeLists.txt" with *QtCreator*.
- Optional: configure your default's "Kit" build directory to e.g. `~/builds/`.
- Specify `-j8` on "Projects", "Build & Run", "Kit-name", "Build", "Build Steps", and `root.exe` as your executable in the run settings.
- Optional: also specify the "Working directory".
- "Tools", "Options", "Analyzer", "Valgrind", "Add", "etc/valgrind-root.supp" and "etc/helgrind-root.supp" from your cloned repository.

Setting up all this platform requires some initial effort, but once it is running, it will smooth your development and bug hunting, and once you've get used to it, you will find it much more tiring to program without it ;) .
