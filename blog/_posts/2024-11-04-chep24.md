In October 2024, the computing community in high-energy and nuclear physics met in Krakow at the [CHEP24 conference](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/).
The ROOT team contributed numerous talks on various new developments of the project.

The highlights were certainly the plenary talks on [RNTuple getting ready for production](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6077632/) and
[the ROOT project at the end of Run 3](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6009812/).

Also check out the various parallel contributions on the adoption of RNTuple (search for "RNTuple" [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/)),
[pip install root](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6010410/), or [Distributed analysis in production with RDataFrame](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6010692/).
