In October 2024, the software and computing community in high-energy and nuclear physics met in Krakow at the [CHEP24 conference](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/).
The event featured a rich scientific program in a great location.

The delegation of the ROOT core developers in Krakow presented ten contributions on various new developments of the project.
Check out the various parallel talks on the adoption of RNTuple (search for "RNTuple" [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/)),
on [pip install root](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6010410/), or [Distributed analysis in production with RDataFrame](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6010692/)!

Among the highlights were certainly the plenary talks on [RNTuple getting ready for production](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6077632/) and
[the ROOT project at the end of Run 3 and its future plans for HL-LHC](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6009812/).
They presented a great overview of the matter, and also contain plenty of links to the other ROOT talks with more details.
Have a look if this sparked your curiosity!
