Hi,

It's time to resume this blog - on what the ROOT team is up to; what happens at the C++ meetings; and a bit of behind-the-scenes of cling and ROOT.

We have started to develop towards ROOT 7 and [its new interfaces](https://indico.cern.ch/event/349459/session/1/contribution/3). We will have bi-weekly meetings to discuss some of items relevant for our users - we'd love to have you involved as much as possible! If you are curious then please [subscribe to the root7-discussion egroup](https://egroups.cern.ch).

Already now, before the first meeting, we have an interesting case: new interfaces should nicely interoperate with the standard library; as such we want them to have members called `empty()` and `size()`.
On the other hand they are ROOT classes - and you are used to `IsEmpty()` and `GetSize()`.
And inconsistent interfaces are the worst.

Which of these options do you prefer, and why?

1.   Offer both `GetSize()` and `size()`, one calling the other.
2.   If a class is called `TWhatever` it has `GetSize()`. Call the class `ROOT::whatever` to signal that is follows the standard library coding conventions, i.e. `size()`.
3.  `TWhatever::size()` is just fine and not a problem.

I'm leaning towards the second option. Others prefer the first. And you?

Cheers, Axel.
