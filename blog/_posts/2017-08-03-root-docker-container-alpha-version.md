Do you like [Docker](https://docker.com/)? Would you like to use ROOT? We provide
an *alpha* version of the ROOT [Docker](https://docker.com/) container!

We traditionally offer several ways of using ROOT: source distributions for the users to compile on their systems, binary distributions for most popular platforms, central installations on [CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) or via cloud services such as [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch)
We felt we needed an additional step to make ROOT more usable: this is the reason why we provide an *alpha* version of ROOT as a [Docker](https://docker.com/) container.

Check out the copy/paste instructions (a one liner!) [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/rootproject/root-ubuntu16/).
