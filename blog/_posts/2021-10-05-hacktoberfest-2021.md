The ROOT GitHub repository is open for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) contributions!

## What is it?

Hacktoberfest is a yearly event that encourages participation in open source communities and projects. Would you like to
help us with some (not so scary) bugs? Or maybe you have some place in our documentation that you think deserves some
love? Any small but noticeable feature you would like to see in ROOT? This definitely is a nice time to give your
support to the project!

## How does it work?

You just have to submit a PR to our repository. If it gets approved, it will count towards your hacktoberfest points.
Check out the Hacktoberfest website for a full list of rules. Take a look at our issues labeled ["good first issue"](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get started, or feel free to make a
PR about your own ideas! Just make sure [you're not a bot](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6534/files) ðŸ˜…
