The ROOT documentation needed a big update.
It was spread over three different main manuals:

  - The _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_
  - The _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_
  - The _Old ROOT User’s Guide_

The _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_ and the
_[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ are the current valid sources of documentation.
_[The Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ acts as a "User's Guide" helping users to find their way into the huge amount of documentation
provided in the _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_.
The _Old User's Guide_ is outdated and not updated but, nevertheless it contains some valuable
information we do not want to lose.

During one full week all the ROOT team was involved in a big update of the
_[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ and _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_.

The first task was to make sure the Manual’s table of content was complete: by
groups of experts, we updated the existing chapters ([Histograms]({{ '/manual/Histograms' | relative_url }}),
[Graphs]({{ '/manual/graphs' | relative_url }}), [Trees]({{ '/manual/trees' | relative_url }}) ...)
and create the new needed ones ([JSROOT]({{ '/manual/jsroot' | relative_url }}), [
ROOT I/O]({{ '/manual/root_io' | relative_url }})...) which also
led to updates in the _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_.

Another task was be to move all the valuable information now in the _Old User’s
Guide_ to the relevant places: outdated parts were removed or
updated in the _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ or in the
_[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_. Finally we will drop
completely the _Old User’s Guide_ and have an accurate, minimal but sufficiently complete
_[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_.

The new structure _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_/_[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_
will work in a more complementary, simpler and proactive way for updates either
via Pull requests (on [web site repository](https://github.com/root-project/web/pulls) or
[ROOT repository](https://github.com/root-project/root)) or Github issues
(on [web site repository](https://github.com/root-project/web/pulls) or
[ROOT repository](https://github.com/root-project/root/pulls)).
