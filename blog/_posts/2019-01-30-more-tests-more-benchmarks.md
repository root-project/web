title:  "More tests, more benchmarks!"

ROOT relies on testing, including performance testing - and we need to improve both.

When we develop ROOT, we need to know whether things work, and whether they are faster than
before. ROOT has two dedicated repositories for that,
[roottest](https://github.com/root-project/roottest/) and
[rootbench](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench).

The whole community would benefit from additional code in either. Simply open an existing
file and call more functions of the tested feature than before, thus increasing the coverage.

## Expected Results
* Better coverage for roottest or rootbench

## Requirements
Experience with how ROOT is used is certainly a plus.
