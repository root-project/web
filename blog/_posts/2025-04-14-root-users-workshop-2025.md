We are very happy to announce that the ROOT Users Workshop 2025 will take place in Valencia, Spain, between 17-21st November. Please note this will be an in-person-only event. 

The workshop will be a great opportunity to discuss and exchange ideas, share ROOT usage experiences, learn about new features and shape the future of the project together. In particular, we will focus on the following topics: Analysis, I/O & Storage, Math and Stats, and Scientific Python Ecosystem.

To foster the collaborative and friendly spirit of the event, we will organize a few social activities during the evenings, such as a conference dinner and a sightseeing walk around the old town of Valencia.
