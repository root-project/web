ROOT has now a brand new _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_, bringing
_"how do you read data with ROOT"_ and similar core aspects into contemporary ROOT.
Much of the manual has been rethought and simplified, we hope and expect that concepts and
interfaces are now easier to understand !


To achieve this, all the ROOT team was involved in a big update of the
_[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ and _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_
during one full week.

Previously, the ROOT documentation was spread over three different main manuals:

  - The _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_
  - The _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_
  - The _Old ROOT User’s Guide_

The _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_ and the
_[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ are the current valid sources of documentation.
_[The Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ acts as a "User's Guide" helping users to find their way into the huge amount of documentation
provided in the _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_.
The _Old User's Guide_ is outdated and not updated but, nevertheless it contains some valuable
information we do not want to lose.

The first task of the week was to make sure the Manual’s table of content was complete: by
groups of experts, we updated the existing chapters ([Histograms]({{ '/manual/histograms' | relative_url }}),
[Graphs]({{ '/manual/graphs' | relative_url }}), [Trees]({{ '/manual/trees' | relative_url }}) ...)
and create the new needed ones ([JSROOT]({{ '/manual/jsroot' | relative_url }}), [
ROOT I/O]({{ '/manual/root_io' | relative_url }})...) which also
led to updates in the _[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_.

Another task was be to move all the valuable information now in the _Old User’s
Guide_ to the relevant places: outdated parts were removed or
updated in the _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_ or in the
_[Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)_. Finally we will drop
completely the _Old User’s Guide_ and have an accurate and complete
_[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_.


This new  _[Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }})_
allows _you_ to contribute - for instance by letting us know when something
is hard to understand
(by opening an [issue](https://github.com/root-project/web/issues)) or even by fixing it
yourself: see the GitHub octocat at the bottom right corner of each page!

We hope you'll enjoy the new manual, and that it's useful for today's new grad students!
