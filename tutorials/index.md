ROOT offers a rich set of code examples that allow you to see ROOT's building blocks "in
action", as part of more complex programs. They are separated in two categories: C++ or
python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorials are available for all major ROOT releases.
**[These](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html){:target="_blank"}** are the links
for the latest
git snapshot. All scripts are available also in the form of a **ROOTBook** which can be
visualized in
[NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} or tried out interactively in
[SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/){:target="_blank"}.
