ROOT offers a rich set of tutorials that allow you to see ROOT's building blocks "in action",
as part of more complex programs. They are separated in two categories: C++ or python scripts
and Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorials are available for all major ROOT releases.
**[These](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html){:target="_blank"}** are the links for their
latest version. Most tutorials are also available as ROOTBook which can
be visualized in [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} or tried interactively in
[SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch){:target="_blank"}. Such tutorials are marked with these badges:

Once you have [properly setup the ROOT environment]({{'manual/first_steps_with_root' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"},
all the tutorials will be available on *your* machine in the `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` folder.
You can then [execute/read the macros]({{'manual/first_steps_with_root/#root-macros' | relative_url }})
there to learn from the examples. Do not hesitate to comment out/ add code to these tutorials
macros to learn interactively how ROOT works.
