ROOT offers a rich set of tutorials that allow you to see ROOT's building blocks "in action",
as part of more complex programs. They are separated in two categories: C++ or Python scripts
and Jupyter Notebooks.

The tutorials are available for all major ROOT releases.
[These](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html){:target="_blank"} are the links for their
latest version. 

Most tutorials are also available in a form of a ROOTBook which can
be visualized in a [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} or run interactively using
[SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch){:target="_blank"}, indicated with

Once you [properly setup the ROOT environment]({{'manual/first_steps_with_root' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"},
all the tutorials are available on *your* machine in the `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` folder.
You can then [execute/read the macros]({{'manual/root_macros_and_shared_libraries' | relative_url }}) 
to learn from the examples. Do not hesitate to comment out or add your own code to these tutorials
macros to interactively learn how ROOT works.

From the long list of tutorials, we suggest that you start with:
