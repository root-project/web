## These are the aspects the shifter shall keep under control
The shifter summarises the events of the week during the ROOT meeting. The hand-
over to the next shifter must be carefully handled.

### Forum Posts
All forum posts have to be followed up. Some hours can be given to the community
to discuss the questions but an answer from the ROOT team must be given within 24 hours.
It is responsibility of the shifter to make sure this happens, either answering or
involving the relevant expert.

### Failing tests
The shifter has the responsibility to "keep the builds green". She needs to fix
the broken tests in the incremental and nightly builds and/or involve the relevant
experts to make that happen.

### Open pull requests
The shifter has the responsibility to follow up PRs if the relevant expert did
not either interacting with the contributor or involving the relevant expert.
Again, feedback needs to be given within 24 hours after the PR submission.
