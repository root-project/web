The ROOT team has adopted [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} for generating
the ROOT web site. The ROOT web site uses [a forked copy of the
"Minimal-Mistakes" theme](https://github.com/root-project/minimal-mistakes){:target="_blank"}.
Many scripts and functionalities have been added compare to this original theme.

This page gives you the instructions to:

1. Get the sources of the ROOT web site and edit them
2. Generate a local running version of this web site.

## Get the ROOT web site sources

You need to follow the following steps:

1. Make sure have set up git on our system
2. You should have registered a GitHub account and [forked the ROOT web site repository](https://github.com/root-project/web/fork){:target="_blank"}.
3. Clone your forked ROOT web repository locally on your machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/web
```

You now have a copy of the ROOT web site sources from github. You can
work on them, play with a locally served website (next section), and finally
create ["Pull Requests"]({{ 'for_developers/creating_pr' | relative_url}})
to get changes upstream.


## Generate a local running version of the ROOT web site

This section gives you the instructions to generate a local running version
of the ROOT web site. The informations presented here are largely inspired from the
[quick start page of the Jekyll web site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/){:target="_blank"}.

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites/requirements are the same presented on the
[jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements){:target="_blank"}.

### Install instructions

The install instructions differ a bit from the ones you can find on the
[Jekyll web site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/){:target="_blank"}
as you do not need to create a new web site but instead
get it from github. So the steps are:

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/){:target="_blank"}.

2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler){:target="_blank"}
   [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems){:target="_blank"}. This command
   might need to be run in `sudo` mode.
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Get the ROOT web site source from github.
```
git clone https://github.com/root-project/web.git web
```
You can also clone a forked copy from you own github as explained in the
[section on getting the sources](#get-the-root-web-site-sources)

4. Change into your new directory.
```
cd web
```
You will notice that the current git branch is `main`
```
% git checkout
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```
This branch is the one from which the official web site is built. You can create a
new branch with your work, which you can use to create a pull request to update
`root-project/web/main`.

6. Some missing gems might need to be installed. The following command, ran
   in the `web` directory, does it:
```
bundle install
```  
7. Build the site and make it available on a local server.
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl="/base"
```
If you only plan to make minor modifications, you can append the `--incremental` flag
to speed up the rebuild process.

6. After about 30 seconds you should get an output similar to
```
Configuration file: /path/to/the/directory/_config.yml
            Source: /path/to/the/directory
       Destination: /path/to/the/directory/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
       Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
                    done in 21.638 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for /path/to/the/directory
    Server address: https://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

8. Your server is now running. As shown above, the website can be accessed using a URL
similar to `https://127.0.0.1:4000/`.

9. Work on the website.
   Each time you create a new file or save a modified version of a file
   the server will notice it and will regenerate the web site. You will get an output
   similar to:
```
Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2020-02-19 10:40:02
              for_developers/index.md
 Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
              ...done in 9.877795 seconds.
```
once "`... done`" is displayed you can reload the web site from your browser to see your
changes. Remember the `--incremental` can speed up serving times considerably.

It is not necessary to restart the server each time you do a modification except if you
modify the file `web/_config.yml`

You may notice that the command `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl="/base"` generates a folder `_site` in
the `/path/to/the/directory/web/` folder. This is the html version of the web site. Do not
modify or create files in that folder. This folder is ignored by git.


## Get modifications upstream

Once you are happy with your modifications, you can publish them via a
["Pull Request"]({{ 'for_developers/creating_pr' | relative_url}}). You
can either push a branch to your fork of the website repository, and create the pull
request from your fork to [https://github.com/root-project/web](https://github.com/root-project/web), or
if you have write access to the `root-project/web` repository, you can directly push a new branch.
If you create a pull request "inside" `root-project/web`, github can create a preview website, which
will be served at `https://root.cern/<PRNumber>` (after the build step completes).

When a pull request is merged, [`https://root.cern/`](https://root.cern/) will be updated automatically
after a short while.
