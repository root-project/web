For the first time since 20 year (i.e. ever), the ROOT team plans to break backward compatibility for crucial interfaces - once.
This new major version of ROOT will make ROOT much simpler and safer to use: we want to increase clarity and usability.
If you are a physicist, please read on - this is about *your* ROOT.


The ROOT team will be releasing parts of ROOT 7 throughout the coming years.
Previews will gradually sneak into the ROOT sources, in the `namespace ROOT::Experimental` for those parts that are not yet cast in stone, and in the `namespace ROOT` for those that are.
We will use standard C++ types, standard interface behavior (e.g. with respect to ownership and thread safety), good documentation and tests: we are trying to be nice!

## Feedback

The main point of the meeting and this page is to solicit *your* feedback. Most of it has been taken care of in the code already.

## Building ROOT 7
### Pre-requisites
Support for the c++14 standard is required. Usage of g++ >= 5 or clang >= 3.4 is recommended.
### Relevant cmake variables
The `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` cmake variables must be set to at least `14`.

Building from source would look similar to this:

    $ mkdir root7_build
    $ cd root7_build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14 path/to/root/source
    $ cmake --build . -- -j4


## Examples

See the [relevant histogram and ntuple tutorials](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/tutorials/v7){:target="_blank"},
and also the [ROOT 7 graphics ones](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/tutorials/rcanvas).
For instance for [drawing and styling the new histograms](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/rcanvas/rh1.cxx){:target="_blank"}.

The new interfaces are not about shortening your code - but about robustness. Here are a few examples of what can go wrong with the ROOT6 interfaces:

```
#include "TFile.h"
#include "TH2.h"
#include "TTreeReader.h"
#include "TTreeReaderArray.h"
#include "TTree.h"

// Another function. Who knows what it does in a month from now.
void someOtherFunction();

void fill(TTree* tree) {
  // Create the file before so it can own the histograms.
  TFile* file = TFile::Open("jetmuontag.root", "RECRAETE");

  // Create the histograms (cannot mix fixed and variable size bins)
  const double muonPtBins[] = {0., 1., 10., 100.};
  // The axis titles might have been changed. Impossible to see.
  TH2* hMuPtTag = new TH2F("hMuPtTag", "muon pT versus tag value;tag value;muon pT [GeV]",
    4, muonPtBins,  10, 0., 1.);
  TH1* hJetEt = new TH1F("hJetEt", "jet ET versus tag value;jet ET [GeV];tag value",
    10, 0., 1000.);

  // Set up reading from the TTree
  TTreeReader reader(tree);
  TTreeReaderArray<float> jetEt(reader, "jet.ET");
  TTreeReaderArray<float> muPt(reader, "jet.lead_mu.pT");
  TTreeReaderArray<float> tag(reader, "jet.tag");

  // Fill the histograms
  while (reader.Next()) {
    for (int iJet = 0; iJet < jetEt.size(); ++iJet) {
      hMuPtTag->Fill(muPt[iJet], tag[iJet]);
      hJetEtTag->Fill(jetEt[iJet], tag[iJet]);
    }
  }

  someOtherFunction();

  // Store the result. Ideally using file->Write() but very few people do that.
  hMuPtTag->Write();
  hJetEtTag->Write();

  delete file; // but not the histograms!
}
```

Here are the problems:

  * Constructing the `TFile`, `"RECRAETE"` is misspelled.
  * The axis titles of `hMuPtJetET` are inverted.
  * The number of `muonPtBins` is wrong.
  * The histogram `hJetEtTag` is filled with weights of `*tag`; that might be a leftover y coordinate.
  * You get two copies of the histogram in the file, one for `histogram->Write()`, one because the histogram is already associated with the file and will be written on file destruction.
  * The call to `someOtherFunction()` might change `gDirectory` and thus `hMuPtJetET` might not be written to jetmuontag.root.

To track these problems down you'd have to spend your time debugging them. Instead, the new interfaces will simply not allow this to happen: no debugging needed!
