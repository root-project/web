The ROOT team has adopted [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl){:target="_blank"} for generating
the [Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/){:target="_blank"}. In this section, you will find [our documentation guidelines]({{'for_developers/docs/guidelines' | relative_url}}), how to [run Doxygen locally]({{'for_developers/docs/local_doxygen' | relative_url}}), how to add [documentation for ROOT's pythonizations]({{'for_developers/docs/pythonizations' | relative_url}}) and a number of [useful tips formatting tips]({{'for_developers/docs/useful_tips' | relative_url}}).
