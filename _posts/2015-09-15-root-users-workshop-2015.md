<h3>ROOT Anniversary Workshop</h3>

<p>The next ROOT Users' Workshop will celebrate ROOT's 20th anniversary. It will take place on 15-18 Sept 2015 in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.saas-fee.ch/en/aktivitaeten-sommer" target="_blank">Saas-Fee, Switzerland</a>.</p>

<p>Since now two decades, ROOT has established itself as the framework for HENP data processing and analysis. The LHC upgrade program and the new experiments being designed at CERN and elsewhere will pose even more formidable challenges in terms of data complexity and size. The new parallel and heterogeneous computing architectures that are either announced or already available trigger deep rethinking of the code and the data structures to be exploited efficiently.</p>

<p>This workshop, following from a successful series of such events, will allow you to learn in detail about the state of ROOT, the plans for ROOT 7, and it will help shape the evolution of ROOT.</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

		<li>Discussion of lessons learnt from a users' survey scheduled for March</li>
		<li>What did you do that's awesome and would benefit everyone?</li>
		<li>Experiments' report: how do physicists use ROOT in analyses and online (DAQ / trigger / monitoring /...), what can we improve?</li>
		<li>We are especially looking for feedback from outside CERN!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Impressions from the outside
	<ul>
		<li>Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, on how to write modern, good C++</li>
		<li>Electronic Arts / EA Sports, on how they do large-scale data analysis for instance for game data</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as&nbsp;<a href="/node/106">the previous workshops</a>, this anniversary workshop is mostly about intense interaction with the ROOT developers: we will discuss, solve, invent and plan. In the past, these workshops have been eye-openers for users and developers - and we expect nothing less for the 9th workshop!&nbsp;</p>
