Try the new [ROOTbooks on Binder (Beta)](http://mybinder.org/repo/cernphsft/rootbinder)! Use ROOT interactively in notebooks and explore to the examples.

Not even two weeks since the release of the [ROOT Jupyter kernel](https://root.cern.ch/root-has-its-jupyter-kernel) and you can already try ROOT interactively on [Binder (Beta)](http://mybinder.org/repo/cernphsft/rootbinder)! Of course, do not hesitate to use your favourite mobile device...

We collected ROOTbooks which illustrate the most striking features of the integration of ROOT with Jupyter technology, using both the C++ and Python languages. Take it as the
documentation for the most impatient user, read the notebooks, execute them interactively, modify them.

Let us surprise you with full blown modern C++ interpretation, interactive graphics, integration with iPython widgets and much more!

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a tool that turns a GitHub repo into a collection of interactive notebooks powered by Jupyter and Kubernetes: follow the link to the [Binder website](https://mybinder.org/) to learn more.
