The ROOT 6.22 release features a new PyROOT, which was previously in experimental mode and is now the
default.

Some highlights of the new PyROOT are:

- **Modern**: its new design on top of cppyy provides more and better support for modern C++. Find more
details about supported C++ features in the [cppyy documentation](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io).

- **Pythonic**: in order to use ROOT from Python in an easier and more Python-like way, new
pythonizations have been added for several ROOT classes, and more will come! They will
be documented as part of the [ROOT reference guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html)
for every class.

- **Interoperable**: the new PyROOT is better integrated in the Python data science ecosystem.
ROOT data can be read into NumPy arrays and pandas dataframes, as shown
[here](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/df026__AsNumpyArrays_8py.html).
[Another example](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/pyroot004__NumbaDeclare_8py.html)
is the ability to compile Python callables with Numba and use them in e.g.
RDataFrame computations.

- **Multi-Python**: a single ROOT build can now create PyROOT libraries for both Python2 and Python3.
[This guide](../install/build_from_source/#root-python-and-pyroot)
explains the steps to achieve that.

Furthermore, [a new PyROOT manual](../manual/python/) is being
written, which will complement the documentation about pythonizations to be included in the
ROOT reference guide.
