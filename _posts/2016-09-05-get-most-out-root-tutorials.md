All [ROOT tutorials](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html) are now available
as ROOTBooks which can be statically visualized via [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) or
interactively explored with [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch).

A great amount of knowledge about the usage of ROOT is distilled in the [ROOT tutorials](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html). Since the early days of the framework, the ROOT team and its collaborators documented the features of the components of ROOT as Tutorials to allow users to "learn by example".
Since some weeks the ROOT tutorials are converted to Jupyter Notebooks automatically during the procedure creating the ROOT documentation and can be accessed in two ways: as statically rendered notebooks via [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) or interactively with [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch).
Look for the blue and orange badges on the [*Tutorials' Pages*](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html)!
