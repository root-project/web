The [CERN Summer Student](https://home.cern/students-educators/summer-student-programme)
program is in full swing and ROOT is part of it.

The [CERN Summer Student](https://home.cern/students-educators/summer-student-programme)
program is in full swing and ROOT is part of it. Today, the second instance of the
[ROOT Summer Students' Course](http://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/root) takes place. A great
success: already 120 students attended the course and a another instance has still to take place.
Many exciting innovations were put in place in [the program](https://github.com/root-mirror/training),
including the usage of a [micro CernVM](https://cernvm.cern.ch/) virtual machine and the
CERN jupyter notebooks' service, [SWAN](http://swan.web.cern.ch/).
