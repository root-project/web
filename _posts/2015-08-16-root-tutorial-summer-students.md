Four instances of the summer student tutorial took place this year: more than 140 people attended.

We would like to thank the CERN HR team for helping us with the organisation and to the
participants for all the previous feedback they gave!

The legacy of this effort is a non negligible amount of high quality material: _slides, video
recording of the lecture, Jupyter notebooks, rootfiles and code examples_
