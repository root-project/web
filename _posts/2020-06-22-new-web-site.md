If you are reading this blog post it means you are surfing on the New ROOT Web Site!

This new web site is a complete redesigned both on the content point of view and on the
the technology used to build it.

Regarding the later we are now using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) system. Jekyll is a
simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.
Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the
open source MIT license. The main advantages are:

  - As it is closely linked to Github, ROOT users and developpers can make Pull Request
    on it as one would do on the ROOT code. It makes the changes must easier!
  - The look and feel of the web site in "theme based". We choose the
    [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) with some
    [customization](https://github.com/root-project/minimal-mistakes).
  - Because the generated site is static, it's much easier to embed ROOT specific tools like
    JSROOT output and therefore have interactive interaction on the plots.

On the contain side we kept the all main items which made the past ROOT web site so successful.
The "Forum & Help", The "ROOT Reference Guide", etc ... 
The main new entries are:

   - "Manual": It provides detailed information about the use and applications of ROOT. 
     It contains many, often interactive examples, so that you can immediately
     start interacting with ROOT.
   - "Install": an equivalent entry already existed in the previous site, but this one has
     been completly re-designed in a more modern way to facilitate the ROOT installation 
     on all possible platforms. 

The ROOT team hope you will enjoy the new ROOT web site! Do not hesitate to give
feedback on it either via the forum or by creating Pull Requests.
