This time we meet in <a href="http://visitsarajevo.ba/?lang=en">Sarajevo</a>, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina -
a buzzing melting pot of cultures since centuries.
The workshop features four days of presentations and discussions on everything ROOT:
what works for you, what doesn't and how ROOT evolves to address future challenges.
ROOT is changing; this is your chance to influence what happens and to interact with all its developers!
Our way of saying "thank you for participating" is to make sure that you have a great time in a unique location!</p>
