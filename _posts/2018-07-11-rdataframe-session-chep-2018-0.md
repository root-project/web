Join the CHEP 2018 BOF to discuss bout the Future of ROOT Based Analysis: sign up
[here](https://doodle.com/poll/28e2wrrq2tga3wcn) and visit the
[indico agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/743070/).

Too much data? Too many cores? TTree analysis is tedious? Come and enjoy an intro plus
discussion of RDataFrame, ROOT's current-generation way of writing super-efficient analyses!
It moves all the intricacies into ROOT's responsibility, leaving you simply with a declarative
formulation of the filters and computations that make up your analysis.
