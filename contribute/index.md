We warmly welcome your contribution to ROOT 🙏! Checkout our [good first issues](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) and [items that could use some help](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22).

There are two ways in which you can contribute:

1. **Submit a pull request** <br>
   You can create a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/root-project/root){:target="_blank"}.
   Simply follow [our guidelines](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
   By providing code this way, you agree to transfer your copyright on the code to the "ROOT project".
   Of course you will be duly credited: for sizable contributions your name will appear in the
   [CREDITS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/root-mirror/root/master/README/CREDITS){:target="_blank"}
   file shipped with every binary and source distribution.
   The copyright transfer helps us with effectively defending the project in case of litigation.

2. **Via the users' contribution section in the forum** <br>
   The Users' Forum has a [section](https://root-forum.cern.ch/c/my-root-app-and-ideas){:target="_blank"}
   which describes how to advertise your feature based on ROOT. It is the
   easiest way to make your code known to the community, even if it will not be
   automatically integrated in ROOT. Some contributions might
   become part of the repository - as it happened for RooFit, TMVA, Eve, to name a few.

Often it is useful to [contact us](https://root-forum.cern.ch){:target="_blank"} first to
discuss the code you want to develop or the bug you want to fix.

You can directly submit a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/new/choose) 
using the predefined templates.

### What about fixing an "easy" bug?

Several of ROOT’s bugs are actually not all that difficult to fix by a C++ programmer able to
handle large code bases - we just don’t get around to actually do it. Maybe you can help?
It’s a great way to exercise how to collaborate in a vivid, medium-size project, following
industry best practice. Find your favorite
