## Introduction

ROOT uses the [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/){:target="\_blank"} cross-platform build-generator tool as the
primary build system.<br> CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by
your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT.

If you are really anxious about getting a functional ROOT build, go to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.<br>
If you are a CMake novice, start on [Basic CMake usage]({{'/install/basic_cmake' | relative_url}}) and then go back to the
[Quick Start](#quick-start).
<br>The [Options](#all-build-options) and the [Variables](#relevant-cmake-variables) section is a reference for customizing your build. If you already have experience with CMake, this is the recommended starting point.

## Preparation
Make sure you have installed all [required dependencies]({{'/install/dependencies' | relative_url}}) before building ROOT.

## Quick start

The following are the basic instructions for UNIX-like systems and Windows. We will use the command-line, non-interactive CMake interface. On Windows, open a `[x86|x64] Native Tools Command Prompt for vs 2022`.

1. Download and unpack the [ROOT sources for a specific release]({{'/install/all_releases' | relative_url}}) (make sure to download the "Source distribution" and not a binary distribution) or simply clone ROOT's git repository and check out the branch you would like to build, for example:

   ```bash
   # The latest stable branch gets updated automatically on each release.
   # Your may update your local copy by issuing a `git pull` command.
   # The `--depth=1` option will save some download time during clone at the cost of
   # slightly increased time for the first `git pull`.
   $ git clone --branch latest-stable --depth=1 https://github.com/root-project/root.git root_src
   ```
   In the following we will refer to the directory where ROOT sources are (e.g. `root_src` above) as `<sourcedir>`.

2. Create a directory for the build and a directory for the installation. It is not supported to build ROOT in the source directory. Then change (`cd`) to the build directory:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir <builddir> <installdir>
   $ cd <builddir>
   ```

3. Execute the `cmake` command on the shell replacing `<sourcedir>` and `<installdir>` appropriately.

   On UNIX-like systems:
   ```bash
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installdir> <sourcedir>
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```bat
   cmake -G"Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32 -Thost=x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installdir> <sourcedir>
   ```
   `-G"Visual Studio 17 2022"` is the generator (here Visual Studio 2022), `-A Win32` is for the architecture (here 32 bit), so replace `-A Win32` with `-A x64` to build in 64 bit mode, and `-Thost=x64` is to use the native x64 toolset (to increase the available memory for the builds).

   CMake will detect your development environment, perform a series of test and generate the files required for building ROOT. CMake will use default values for all build parameters. See the [Build Options](#all-build-options) and [Variables](#relevant-cmake-variables) sections for fine-tuning your build.

   This can fail if CMake cannot detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. In this case make sure that the toolset that you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell and that the shell itself is the correct one for you development environment. You can force CMake to use a given build tool, see the Usage section.

4. Proceed to use IDE project files or start the build from the build directory, after CMake has finished running:

   On UNIX-like systems:
   ```bash
   $ cmake --build . --target install [-- <options to the native tool>]
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```bat
   cmake --build . --config [Release|Debug|RelWithDebInfo] --target install [-- <options to the native tool>]
   ```
   On Windows, the `--config [Release|Debug|RelWithDebInfo]` is needed at build time.

   The `--build` option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).

   The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but the` cmake --build` command is more portable.

   On UNIX systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the build with `cmake --build . --  -jN` where N is the number of available cores.

5. Setup ROOT in your environment:

   On UNIX-like systems:
   ```bash
   $ source <installdir>/bin/thisroot.sh # also available for other shells: thisroot.csh, thisroot.fish, thisroot.bat
   ```
   To have ROOT setup automatically at each login, that command can be appended to a `.profile`, `.login`, `.bashrc` or equivalent configuration file.

   On Windows:
   ```bat
   <installdir>/bin/thisroot.bat # also available for PowerShell: thisroot.ps1
   ```

## Caveats

As it makes use of a C++ interpreter, ROOT has somewhat stricter requirements than other C++ libraries: applications that depend on ROOT
*must* be compiled with the same C++ standard with which ROOT was compiled.

Also note that compatibility with compilers shipped with `devtoolset`s on CentOS or Red Hat is not guaranteed.

## ROOT, Python and PyROOT

PyROOT, the set of Python bindings of ROOT, supports any Python version that is not [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
This means it supports the 5 latest major versions of Python 3 and Python 2 is not supported anymore.

ROOT uses the standard [`FindPython3`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython3.html) from CMake to find Python at build time.
You can give it [some hints](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython3.html#hints) to find the desired Python installation.
To precisely control the Python version that PyROOT is built against, we recommend using a `virtualenv` or `conda` environment, because CMake will first look for Python in active virtual environments.
Alternatively, you can define the `Python3_ROOT_DIR` hint in the CMake configuration step.

## Setting the C++ standard

ROOT needs to be configured and built with the same C++ standard as the programs that will make use of it.
The relevant cmake flag is [`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD.html){:target="_blank"}.
For example, from the command line, the standard can be selected by passing one of 11, 14, 17,... such as `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`.
Generally speaking, newer standards are only supported by newer ROOT versions.

### Minimal C++ standards
- C++11 is supported until ROOT v6.24: subsequent versions require at least C++14.
- C++14 is supported until ROOT v6.28: subsequent versions require at least C++17.


### ROOT STL backports

ROOT backports certain modern C++ standard library features to make them available in older standards like C++14, for example `std::string_view`.
The backports can be found [here in the reference guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/dir_7780993579c9aa6baf9598fd7cc29d54.html).
The backports are disabled, falling back to the actual C++ standard library implementation if it provides it, depending for instance on the C++ standard ROOT is compiled with and the compiler version.

## Building ROOT with CUDA support

To build ROOT with CUDA support, you need to have [Nvidia's CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit){:target="\_blank"} installed,
and optionally [Nvidia's Cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn){:target="\_blank"} library. The relevant CMake
options to set are `CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER` (usually set to the same as `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`), and `CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD`.
Starting with ROOT 6.20.06 it is possible to set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` and `CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD` to different values
to allow to compile ROOT with C++17 while CUDA code with C++14 when using CUDA 9 or 10. In addition to these options,
the relevant ROOT build options to enable are `-Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON`.

## System-wide installation

There are two main methods of installing ROOT from source: _location independent_ and _fixed location_. The former is
advised for a personal installation of ROOT, while the latter for a system-wide installation. Both require to set the
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable at configuration time (its default is `/usr/local` if unset). The mode of installation
is controlled via the `gnuinstall` option during configuration.

### Location Independent Installation (gnuinstall=OFF)

This is the configuration used by the binary releases on the website. This method requires setting environment variables
such as `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `PYTHONPATH`. This is usually done by sourcing the script `bin/thisroot.sh` or
equivalent for your shell from the installation directory. The installation can be done by running

```
$ cmake --build . --target install
```

from the build directory. If ROOT is built with `-Drpath=ON`, then it is usually not necessary to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
after installation. It is also important to note that with this method it is usually not possible to customize
installation paths like `CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR`, `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, etc.

### Fixed Location Installation (gnuinstall=ON)

The fixed location installation method is enabled with `-Dgnuinstall=ON` at configuration time, which then also allows
the tuning of destinations for the various components by setting the variables `CMAKE_INSTALL_xxxDIR`, where `xxx` is `BIN`,
`LIB`, `INCLUDE`, etc. The full list is available in `cmake/modules/RootInstallDirs.cmake` inside the repository and
also in the list of variables below. The fixed location installation method does not require setting any environment
variables when ROOT is installed into default system paths (e.g. `/usr`, `/usr/local`). However, if
`CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` is a directory that is not searched for by the linker, it is recommended to enable
`-Drpath=ON` or to add `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` to `/etc/ld.so.conf` in order to avoid having to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
to be able to run ROOT. Nevertheless, it may still be necessary to set `PYTHONPATH` with this method if PyROOT is not
installed into one of the system paths searched for by Python (run `python -m site` to see this list of paths). This
can be done with `export PYTHONPATH=$(root-config --libdir)` if `root-config` is already in your `PATH`.

## All build options

Each build option is a boolean variable that can be turned ON or OFF. The current value is recorded in the CMake cache (CMakeCache.txt file on the build directory) and therefore it is not needed to be specified on the cmake command each time. Please note that some of the options might be turned OFF automatically for some platforms or if the required external library or component can not be satisfied. The user can view and edit the full list of options using the `ccmake` utility or `cmake-gui` for Windows. Note that on Windows some of the options are not yet implemented.

The user can set any CMake variable or option that controls the build process from the `cmake` command line. Passing `cmake -D <var>=<value>` creates an entry in the CMake cache. The list of the ROOT-specific CMake options can be found below.
**Note**: Some options have platform-dependent default values (e.g. cocoa is `ON` on apple)

### Additional variables
A number of additional variables to control the way ROOT is built.

| Variable | Type | Explanation |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| LLVM_BUILD_TYPE | STRING | Build type for the bundled LLVM. It is used to set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for the /interpreter/ subdirectory |

### External libraries

ROOT requires a number of external libraries that the CMake system needs to locate. The list of externals depends on the build options that have been enabled. CMake will look for these third party products at a number of standard places in your system but the user can influence the search by setting some environment variables before invoking the CMake command or by setting package specific CMake variables to their exact location.

The actual cached values used by CMake for the exact location of libraries and include files of the used external libraries can be inspected and modified using the `ccmake` utility.
