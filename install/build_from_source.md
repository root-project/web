## Introduction

ROOT uses the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/){:target="_blank"} cross-platform build-generator tool as the
primary build system.<br> `CMake` does not build the project, it generates the files needed by
your build tool (GNU make, Ninja,  Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT.

If you are really anxious about getting a functional ROOT build, go to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.<br>
If you are a `CMake` novice, start on [Basic CMake usage]({{'/install/basic_cmake' | relative_url}}) and then go back to the
[Quick Start](#quick-start).
<br>The [Options](#build-options) and the [Variables](#variables) section is a reference for customizing your build. If you already have experience with `CMake`,
this is the recommended starting point.

## Preparation
Make sure you have installed all [required dependencies]({{'/install/dependencies' | relative_url}}) before building ROOT.

## Quick start

The following are the basic instructions for UNIX-like systems. We will use the command-line, non-interactive `CMake` interface.

1. Download and unpack the [ROOT sources for a specific release]({{'/install/binary_releases' | relative_url}}) (make sure to download the "Source distribution" and not a binary distribution) or simply clone ROOT's git repository and check out the branch you would like to build, for example:
```bash
# substitute `v6-20-00-patches` with the patches branch of the latest release
$ git clone --branch v6-20-00-patches https://github.com/root-project/root.git root_src
```
In the following we will refer to the directory where ROOT sources are (e.g. `root_src` above) as `<sourcedir>`.
1. Create a directory for the build and a directory for the installation. It is not supported to build ROOT in the source directory. Then change (`cd`) to the build directory:
```bash
$ mkdir <builddir> <installdir>
$ cd <builddir>
```
1. Execute the `cmake` command on the shell replacing `<sourcedir>` and `<installdir>` appropriately:
```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installdir> <sourcedir>
```
`CMake` will detect your development environment, perform a series of test and generate the files required for building ROOT. `CMake` will use default values for all build parameters. See the [Build Options](#options) and [Variables](#variables) sections for fine-tuning your build
This can fail if `CMake` cannot detect your toolset, or if it thinks that the environment is not sane enough. In this case make sure that the toolset that you intend to use is the only one reachable from the shell and that the shell itself is the correct one for you development environment. You can force `CMake` to use a given build tool, see the Usage section.
1. Proceed to use IDE project files or start the build from the build directory, after `CMake` has finished running:
```bash
$ cmake --build . --target install [-- <options to the native tool>]
```
The `--build` option tells cmake to invoke the underlying build tool (make, ninja, xcodebuild, msbuild, etc).
The underlying build tool can also be invoked directly of course, but the` cmake --build` command is more portable.
On UNIX systems (with make or ninja) you can speedup the build with `cmake --build . --  -jN` where N is the number of available cores.
1. Setup ROOT in your environment:
```bash
$ source <installdir>/bin/thisroot.sh # or thisroot.{csh,fish,bat} depending on the environment
```
To have ROOT setup automatically at each login, that command can be appended to a `.profile`, `.login`, `.bashrc` or equivalent configuration file.

## ROOT, Python and PyROOT

> TODO: explain what build options are relevant, what they do, Python2/Python3, etc.

## Setting the C++ standard

> TODO: explain how ROOT features/STL backports interact with C++ standards and how to pick a standard

## Enabling experimental features, aka ROOT 7

> TODO: explain how to build ROT with ROOT 7 enabled

## Building ROOT with CUDA suppot

> TODO: explain how to add support for CUDA, what build options are important...

## Built-in dependencies and external dependencies

> TODO: explain how built-in work, which libraries are available as built-in (or how to find out), what the behavior is, mention fail-on-missing, etc.

## System-wide installation

> TODO: explain how to install ROOT as a system package, i.e. using gnuinstall and installing in /opt

## All build options

Each build option is a boolean variable that can be turned ON or OFF. The current value is recorded in the CMake cache (CMakeCache.txt file on the build directory) and therefore it is not needed to be specified on the cmake command each time. Please note that some of the options might be turned OFF automatically for some platforms or if the required external library or component can not be satisfied. The user can view and edit the full list of options using the `ccmake` utility or `cmake-gui` for Windows. Note that on Windows some of the options are not yet implemented.

The user can set any CMake variable or option that controls the build process from the `cmake` command line. The command using the option `-D <var>:<type>=<value>` creates an entry in the CMake cache. This is the list of the ROOT-specific CMake options:

### Additional variables
A number of additional variables to control the way ROOT is built.

| Variable | Type | Explanation |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| LLVM_BUILD_TYPE | STRING | Build type for the bundled LLVM. It is used to set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for the /interpreter/ subdirectory |

### External libraries

> TODO: do users need to know about the actual CMake variables?

ROOT requires a number of external libraries that the `CMake` system needs to locate. The list of externals depends on the build options that have been enabled. CMake will look for these third party products at a number of standard places in your system but the user can influence the search by setting some environment variables before invoking the CMake command or by setting package specific CMake variables to their exact location.

The actual cached values used by CMake for the exact location of libraries and include files of the used external libraries can be inspected and modified using the `ccmake` utility.
