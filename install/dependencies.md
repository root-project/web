The page lists the prerequisite packages that need to be installed on the different platforms to be able to configure, build and run ROOT.

The table of content can be used to quickly jump to your operating system.

For a more comprehensive list of dependencies depending on the operating system version,
we recommend checking the [docker image repository](https://github.com/root-project/root-docker/tree/master), under the file `packages` of your corresponding system

```

CentOS 8 requires adding the EPEL repository. Additionally, some packages in CentOS 8 [were moved to the PowerTools repository](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/root-dependencies-can-not-install-in-centos8/42010). Therefore it needs to be enabled as well:
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
sudo yum install gcc-gfortran pcre-devel \
mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel glew-devel ftgl-devel mysql-devel \
fftw-devel cfitsio-devel graphviz-devel libuuid-devel \
avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel openldap-devel python-devel python3-numpy \
libxml2-devel gsl-devel readline-devel qt5-qtwebengine-devel \
R-devel R-Rcpp-devel R-RInside-devel
```

## Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions

Use `sudo apt install <package>` or use the graphical "Synaptic Package Manager" program.

### Required packages

**Installing required packages with a one-liner:**

```bash
sudo apt install binutils cmake dpkg-dev g++ gcc libssl-dev git libx11-dev \
libxext-dev libxft-dev libxpm-dev python3 libtbb-dev libvdt-dev libgif-dev
```

Some more context:
  * **dpkg-dev**:  for dpkg-architecture (needed by configure to locate system libraries)
  * **libvdt-dev:** vectorization library, available starting from Ubuntu 23.10, otherwise builtin is used.
  * **python3:** see [here](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/#root-python-and-pyroot) for info on supported Python versions

**Installing most common optional packages with a one-liner:**

```bash
sudo apt install gfortran libpcre3-dev \
libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libftgl-dev \
libfftw3-dev libcfitsio-dev libgraphviz-dev \
libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libldap2-dev \
 python3-dev python3-numpy libxml2-dev libkrb5-dev \
libgsl-dev qtwebengine5-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libmysqlclient-dev \
libgl2ps-dev \
liblzma-dev libxxhash-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev
```

Some more context:
  * **nlohmann-json3-dev:** required for **ROOTEve** and **RooFit**
  * **python3-numpy:** needed for PyMVA
  * **qtwebengine5-dev:** required for **qt5web** component
  * **r-base:** needed for R bindings. In addition R packages **Rcpp** and **RInside** need to be installed.

On Debian, substitute `libmysqlclient-dev` with `libmariadb-dev`.

## openSUSE

Minimal set:

```bash
sudo zypper install bash binutils cmake gcc gcc-c++ git libXext-devel \
libXft-devel libXpm-devel python xrootd-client-devel xrootd-libs-devel
```

Most common optional packages:

```bash
sudo zypper install gcc-fortran pcre-devel Mesa glew-devel libpng16-devel \
pkgconf-pkg-config libmariadb-devel fftw3-devel cfitsio-devel graphviz-devel \
libdns_sd avahi-compat-mDNSResponder-devel openldap2-devel python-devel python-numpy \
libxml2-devel krb5-devel gsl-devel chromium libQt5Gui-devel libqt5-qtwebengine-devel
```

## MacOS

* **Xcode developer package:** Xcode is found on the Mac App store. Install command line tools through the XCode preferences and/or running in a terminal  `xcode-select --install`

## Windows

### ROOT 6

*   **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** (version >= 16.3)
*   **[Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** (ROOT6 requires at least Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1). The **Community** version is free, fully-featured for students, open-source contributors, and individuals.
The **Desktop Development With C++** workload is also needed. You must manually activate it by clicking on the checkbox available on the installation menu of **Visual Studio Installer**.
*   **[Python](https://python.org)** (see [here](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/#root-python-and-pyroot) for info on supported Python versions). If you download a binary release, you need to install the exact same Python version used for the compilation of the binary.


### ROOT 5 (deprecated)

If you are using Windows make sure you have installed Microsoft Visual C++ (e.g., the
[no-cost edition](https://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/){:target="_blank"}) plus `CMake`.
The `CMake` build will work directly **without the need** to install
[cygwin](https://cygwin.com){:target="_blank"} as it was required previously before the adaption of `CMake`.
