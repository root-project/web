On behalf of the developers, contributors and user community: **welcome to ROOT!**

The [ROOT beginners' guide (aka "Primer")]({{ '/primer' | relative_url }})
is certainly the first document to read to master the power of ROOT.

The [Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }}) introduces you to the main parts of ROOT.

After this introduction,
[tutorial presentations (and video!)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/395198){:target="_blank"} offer a
different, more direct approach to the ROOT fundamental
concepts as well as some hands-on exercise. In order to integrate the information present
in the aforementioned sources, [this collection of ROOT courses](courses){:target="_blank"}
is definitively useful. Once the fundamental concepts have been acquired, a rich set of
[code examples]({{ '/get_started/code_examples' | relative_url }}) are available to dive into the code.

Remember, you can always resort to the
[ROOT Forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch){:target="_blank"}
to find out if someone already solved the problem you are facing or to get help!
