**Abstract**

ROOT is a software framework for data analysis and I/O: a powerful tool to cope
with the demanding tasks typical of state of the art scientific data analysis.
Among its prominent features are an advanced graphical user
interface, ideal for interactive analysis, an interpreter for the C++
programming language, for rapid and efficient prototyping and a
persistence mechanism for C++ objects, used also to write every year
petabytes of data recorded by the Large Hadron Collider experiments.
This introductory guide illustrates the main features of ROOT which are
relevant for the typical problems of data analysis: input and plotting of data
from measurements and fitting of analytical functions.

# Motivation and Introduction

***Welcome to data analysis!***

Comparison of measurements to theoretical models is one of the standard
tasks in experimental physics. In the most simple case, a "model" is
just a function providing predictions of measured data. Very often, the
model depends on parameters. Such a model may simply state "the current
*I* is proportional to the voltage *U*", and the task of the
experimentalist consists of determining the resistance, *R*, from a set
of measurements.

As a first step, a visualisation of the data is needed. Next, some
manipulations typically have to be applied, e.g. corrections or
parameter transformations. Quite often, these manipulations are complex
ones, and a powerful library of mathematical functions and procedures
should be provided - think for example of an integral or peak-search or
a Fourier transformation applied to an input spectrum to obtain the
actual measurement described by the model.

One specialty of experimental physics are the inevitable uncertainties
affecting each measurement, and visualisation tools have to include
these. In subsequent analysis, the statistical nature of the errors must
be handled properly.

As the last step, measurements are compared to models, and free model
parameters need to be determined in this process. See Figure [1.1](#f11) for an
example of a function (model) fit to data points. Several standard methods are
available, and a data analysis tool should provide easy access to more
than one of them. Means to quantify the level of agreement between
measurements and model must also be available.

%}


Quite often, the data volume to be analyzed is large - think of
fine-granular measurements accumulated with the aid of computers. A
usable tool therefore must contain easy-to-use and efficient methods for
storing and handling data.

In Quantum mechanics, models typically only predict the probability
density function ("pdf") of measurements depending on a number of
parameters, and the aim of the experimental analysis is to extract the
parameters from the observed distribution of frequencies at which
certain values of the measurement are observed. Measurements of this
kind require means to generate and visualize frequency distributions,
so-called histograms, and stringent statistical treatment to extract the
model parameters from purely statistical distributions.

Simulation of expected data is another important aspect in data
analysis. By repeated generation of "pseudo-data", which are analysed in
the same manner as intended for the real data, analysis procedures can
be validated or compared. In many cases, the distribution of the
measurement errors is not precisely known, and simulation offers the
possibility to test the effects of different assumptions.

A powerful software framework addressing all of the above requirements
is ROOT, an open source project coordinated by the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research, CERN in Geneva.

ROOT is very flexible and provides both a programming interface to use in own
applications and a graphical user interface for interactive data analysis. The
purpose of this document is to serve as a beginners guide and provides extendible
examples for your own use cases, based on typical problems addressed in
student labs. This guide will hopefully lay the ground for more complex
applications in your future scientific work building on a modern,
state-of the art tool for data analysis.

This guide in form of a tutorial is intended to introduce you quickly to the
ROOT package. This goal will be accomplished using concrete examples, according
to the "learning by doing" principle. Also because of this reason, this guide
cannot cover all the complexity of the ROOT package. Nevertheless, once you feel
confident with the concepts presented in the following chapters, you will be
able to navigate through the [Reference Guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/index.html) to
find all the details you might be
interested in. You can even look at the code itself, since ROOT is a
free, open-source product. Use these documents in parallel to this
tutorial!

The ROOT Data Analysis Framework itself is written in and heavily relies
on the `C++` programming language: some knowledge about `C++` is required.
Just take advantage from the immense available literature about `C++` if you do
not have any idea of what this language is about.

ROOT is available for many platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows...), but
in this guide we will implicitly assume that you are using Linux. The
first thing you need to do with ROOT is install it, don't you ? Obtaining
the latest ROOT version is straightforward. Just seek the "Pro" version
on [the download page]({{'download' | relative_url}}).
You will find precompiled versions for the different architectures, or
the ROOT source code to compile yourself. Just pick up the flavour you
need and follow the installation instructions.

**Let's dive into ROOT!**

# ROOT Basics

Now that you have installed ROOT, what's this interactive shell thing
you're running ? It's like this: ROOT leads a double life. It has an
interpreter for macros (Cling) that you can run from the command
line or run like applications. But it is also an interactive shell that
can evaluate arbitrary statements and expressions. This is extremely
useful for debugging, quick hacking and testing. Let us first have a
look at some very simple examples.

## ROOT as calculator

You can even use the ROOT interactive shell in lieu of a calculator!
Launch the ROOT interactive shell with the command

{% highlight C++ %}
 > root
{% endhighlight %}

on your Linux box. The prompt should appear shortly:

{% highlight C++ %}
 root [0]
{% endhighlight %}

and let's dive in with the steps shown here:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [0] 1+1
(int) 2
root [1] 2*(4+2)/12.
(double) 1.000000
root [2] sqrt(3.)
(double) 1.732051
root [3] 1 > 2
(bool) false
root [4] TMath::Pi()
(double) 3.141593
root [5] TMath::Erf(.2)
(double) 0.222703
{% endhighlight %}

Not bad. You can see that ROOT offers you the possibility not only to
type in `C++` statements, but also advanced mathematical functions,
which live in the `TMath` namespace.

Now let's do something more elaborated. A numerical example with the
well known geometrical series:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [6] double x=.5
(double) 0.500000
root [7] int N=30
(int) 30
root [8] double geom_series=0
(double) 0.000000
root [9] for (int i=0;i<N;++i)geom_series+=TMath::Power(x,i)
root [10]  cout << TMath::Abs(geom_series - (1-TMath::Power(x,N-1))/(1-x)) <<endl;
1.86265e-09
{% endhighlight %}

Here we made a step forward. We even declared variables and used a *for*
control structure. Note that there are some subtle differences between
Cling and the standard `C++` language. You do not need the ";" at the end
of line in interactive mode -- try the difference e.g. using the command
at line `root [6]`.

## Learn C++ at the ROOT prompt
Behind the ROOT prompt there is an interpreter based on a real compiler toolkit:
LLVM. It is therefore possible to exercise many features of `C++` and the
standard library. For example in the following snippet we define a lambda
function, a vector and we sort it in different ways:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [0] using doubles = std::vector<double>;
root [1] auto pVec = [](const doubles& v){for (auto&& x:v) cout << x << endl;};
root [2] doubles v{0,3,5,4,1,2};
root [3] pVec(v);
0
3
5
4
1
2
root [4] std::sort(v.begin(),v.end());
root [5] pVec(v);
0
1
2
3
4
5
root [6] std::sort(v.begin(),v.end(),[](double a, double b){return a>b;});
root [7] pVec(v);
5
4
3
2
1
0
{% endhighlight %}

Or, if you prefer random number generation:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [0] std::default_random_engine generator;
root [1] std::normal_distribution<double> distribution(0.,1.);
root [2] distribution(generator)
(std::normal_distribution<double>::result_type) -1.219658e-01
root [3] distribution(generator)
(std::normal_distribution<double>::result_type) -1.086818e+00
root [4] distribution(generator)
(std::normal_distribution<double>::result_type) 6.842899e-01
{% endhighlight %}

Impressive isn't it?

## ROOT as function plotter
Using one of ROOT's powerful classes, here `TF1` [^1], will allow us to
display a function of one variable, *x*. Try the following:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [11] TF1 f1("f1","sin(x)/x",0.,10.);
root [12] f1.Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

`f1` is an instance of a TF1 class, the arguments are used
in the constructor; the first one of type string is a name to be entered
in the internal ROOT memory management system, the second string type
parameter defines the function, here `sin(x)/x`, and the two parameters
of type double define the range of the variable *x*. The `Draw()`
method, here without any parameters, displays the function in a window
which should pop up after you typed the above two lines.

A slightly extended version of this example is the definition of a
function with parameters, called `[0]`, `[1]` and so on in the ROOT
formula syntax. We now need a way to assign values to these parameters;
this is achieved with the method
`SetParameter(<parameter_number>,<parameter_value>)` of class `TF1`.
Here is an example:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [13] TF1 f2("f2","[0]*sin([1]*x)/x",0.,10.);
root [14] f2.SetParameter(0,1);
root [15] f2.SetParameter(1,1);
root [16] f2.Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, this version shows the same results as the initial one. Try
playing with the parameters and plot the function again. The class `TF1`
has a large number of very useful methods, including integration and
differentiation. To make full use of this and other ROOT classes, visit
the documentation on the Internet under
<https://root.cern/doc/master/>. Formulae in ROOT
are evaluated using the class `TFormula`, so also look up the relevant
class documentation for examples, implemented functions and syntax.

You should definitely download this guide to your own system to have it
at you disposal whenever you need it.

To extend a little bit on the above example, consider a more complex
function you would like to define. You can also do this using standard
`C` or `C++` code.

Consider the example below, which calculates and displays the
interference pattern produced by light falling on a multiple slit.
Please do not type in the example below at the ROOT command line, there
is a much simpler way: Make sure you have the file `slits.C` on disk,
and type `root slits.C` in the shell. This will start root and make it
read the "macro" `slits.C`, i.e. all the lines in the file will be
executed one after the other.

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Example drawing the interference pattern of light
// falling on a grid with n slits and ratio r of slit
// width over distance between slits.

auto pi = TMath::Pi();

// function code in C
double single(double *x, double *par) {
  return pow(sin(pi*par[0]*x[0])/(pi*par[0]*x[0]),2);
}

double nslit0(double *x,double *par){
  return pow(sin(pi*par[1]*x[0])/sin(pi*x[0]),2);
}

double nslit(double *x, double *par){
  return single(x,par) * nslit0(x,par);
}

// This is the main program
void slits() {
  float r,ns;

  // request user input
  cout << "slit width / g ? ";
  scanf("%f",&r);
  cout << "# of slits? ";
  scanf("%f",&ns);
  cout <<"interference pattern for "<< ns
       <<" slits, width/distance: "<<r<<endl;

  // define function and set options
  TF1 *Fnslit  = new TF1("Fnslit",nslit,-5.001,5.,2);
  Fnslit->SetNpx(500);

  // set parameters, as read in above
  Fnslit->SetParameter(0,r);
  Fnslit->SetParameter(1,ns);

  // draw the interference pattern for a grid with n slits
  Fnslit->Draw();
}

{% endhighlight %}


{% include figure_jsroot sect=2 fig=1
file="canvases.root" object="TF1_DoubleSlit"
caption="Output of slits.C with parameters 0.2 and 2."
%}


The example first asks for user input, namely the ratio of slit width
over slit distance, and the number of slits. After entering this
information, you should see the graphical output as is shown in Figure [2.1](#f21).

This is a more complicated example than the ones we have seen before, so
spend some time analysing it carefully, you should have understood it
before continuing. Let us go through it in detail:

Lines *7-18* define the necessary functions in `C++` code, split into
three separate functions, as suggested by the problem considered. The
full interference pattern is given by the product of a function
depending on the ratio of the width and distance of the slits, and a
second one depending on the number of slits. More important for us here
is the definition of the interface of these functions to make them
usable for the ROOT class `TF1`: the first argument is the pointer to
*x*, the second one points to the array of parameters.

The main program starts at line 21 with the definition of a function
`slits()` of type `void`. After asking for user input, a ROOT function
is defined using the C-type function given in the beginning. We can now
use all methods of the `TF1` class to control the behaviour of our
function -- nice, isn't it ?

If you like, you can easily extend the example to also plot the
interference pattern of a single slit, using function `double single`,
or of a grid with narrow slits, function `double nslit0`, in `TF1`
instances.

Here, we used a macro, some sort of lightweight program, that the
interpreter distributed with ROOT, Cling, is able to execute. This is a
rather extraordinary situation, since `C++` is not natively an interpreted
language! There is much more to say: chapter is indeed dedicated to
macros.

## Controlling ROOT

One more remark at this point: as every command you type into ROOT is
usually interpreted by Cling, an "escape character" is needed to pass
commands to ROOT directly. This character is the dot at the beginning of
a line:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [1] .<command>
{% endhighlight %}

This is a selection of the most common commands.

-   **quit root**, simply type `.q`

-   obtain a **list of commands**, use `.?`

-   **access the shell** of the operating system, type `.!<OS_command>`;
    try, e.g. `.!ls` or `.!pwd`

-   **execute a macro**, enter `.x <file_name>`; in the above example,
    you might have used `.x slits.C` at the ROOT prompt

-   **load a macro**, type `.L <file_name>`; in the above example, you
    might instead have used the command `.L slits.C` followed by the
    function call `slits();`. Note that after loading a macro all
    functions and procedures defined therein are available at the ROOT
    prompt.

-   **compile a macro**, type `.L <file_name>+`; ROOT is able to manage
    for you the `C++` compiler behind the scenes and to produce machine
    code starting from your macro. One could decide to compile a macro
    in order to obtain better performance or to get nearer to the
    production environment.

Use `.help` at the prompt to inspect the full list.

## Plotting Measurements

To display measurements in ROOT, including errors, there exists a
powerful class `TGraphErrors` with different types of constructors. In
the example here, we use data from the file `ExampleData.txt` in text
format:

{% highlight C++ %}
root [0] TGraphErrors gr("ExampleData.txt");
root [1] gr.Draw("AP");
{% endhighlight %}

You should see the output shown in Figure [2.2](#f22).

{% include figure_jsroot sect=2 fig=2
file="canvases.root" object="TGraphErrors_Example"
caption="Visualisation of data points with errors using the class TGraphErrors."
%}


Make sure the file `ExampleData.txt` is available in the directory from
which you started ROOT. Inspect this file now with your favourite
editor, or use the command `less ExampleData.txt` to inspect the file,
you will see that the format is very simple and easy to understand.
Lines beginning with `#` are ignored. It is very convenient to add some
comments about the type of data. The data itself consist of lines with
four real numbers each, representing the x- and y- coordinates and their
errors of each data point.

The argument of the method `Draw("AP")` is important here. Behind the scenes,
it tells the `TGraphPainter` class to show the axes and to plot markers at the
*x* and *y* positions of the specified data points. Note that this simple
example relies on the default settings of ROOT, concerning the size of
the canvas holding the plot, the marker type and the line colors and
thickness used and so on. In a well-written, complete example, all this
would need to be specified explicitly in order to obtain nice and well
readable results. A full chapter on graphs will explain many
more of the features of the class `TGraphErrors` and its relation to
other ROOT classes in much more detail.

## Histograms in ROOT

Frequency distributions in ROOT are handled by a set of classes derived
from the histogram class `TH1`, in our case `TH1F`. The letter `F`
stands for "float", meaning that the data type `float` is used to store
the entries in one histogram bin.

{% highlight C++ %}
root [0] TF1 efunc("efunc","exp([0]+[1]*x)",0.,5.);
root [1] efunc.SetParameter(0,1);
root [2] efunc.SetParameter(1,-1);
root [3] TH1F h("h","example histogram",100,0.,5.);
root [4] for (int i=0;i<1000;i++) {h.Fill(efunc.GetRandom());}
root [5] h.Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

The first three lines of this example define a function, an exponential
in this case, and set its parameters. In line *3* a histogram is
instantiated, with a name, a title, a certain number of bins (100 of
them, equidistant, equally sized) in the range from 0 to 5.

{% include figure_jsroot sect=2 fig=3
file="canvases.root" object="TH1F_Example"
caption="Visualisation of a histogram filled with exponentially distributed, random numbers."
%}


We use yet another new feature of ROOT to fill this histogram with data,
namely pseudo-random numbers generated with the method `TF1::GetRandom`,
which in turn uses an instance of the ROOT class `TRandom` created when
ROOT is started. Data is entered in the histogram at line *4* using the
method `TH1F::Fill` in a loop construct. As a result, the histogram is
filled with 1000 random numbers distributed according to the defined
function. The histogram is displayed using the method `TH1F::Draw()`.
You may think of this example as repeated measurements of the life time
of a quantum mechanical state, which are entered into the histogram,
thus giving a visual impression of the probability density distribution.
The plot is shown in Figure [2.3](#f23).

Note that you will not obtain an identical plot when executing the lines
above, depending on how the random number generator is initialised.

The class `TH1F` does not contain a convenient input format from plain
text files. The following lines of `C++` code do the job. One number per
line stored in the text file "expo.dat" is read in via an input stream
and filled in the histogram until end of file is reached.

{% highlight C++ %}
root [1] TH1F h("h","example histogram",100,0.,5.);
root [2] ifstream inp; double x;
root [3] inp.open("expo.dat");
root [4] while (inp >> x) { h.Fill(x); }
root [5] h.Draw();
root [6] inp.close();
{% endhighlight %}

Histograms and random numbers are very important tools in statistical
data analysis, a whole chapter will be dedicated to this topic.

## Interactive ROOT

Look at one of your plots again and move the mouse across. You will
notice that this is much more than a static picture, as the mouse
pointer changes its shape when touching objects on the plot. When the
mouse is over an object, a right-click opens a pull-down menu displaying
in the top line the name of the ROOT class you are dealing with, e.g.
`TCanvas` for the display window itself, `TFrame` for the frame of the
plot, `TAxis` for the axes, `TPaveText` for the plot name. Depending on
which plot you are investigating, menus for the ROOT classes `TF1`,
`TGraphErrors` or `TH1F` will show up when a right-click is performed on
the respective graphical representations. The menu items allow direct
access to the members of the various classes, and you can even modify
them, e.g. change color and size of the axis ticks or labels, the
function lines, marker types and so on. Try it!

{% include figure_image sect=2 fig=4
img="ROOTPanel_SetParameters.png"
caption="Interactive ROOT panel for setting function parameters."
%}


You will probably like the following: in the output produced by the
example `slits.C`, right-click on the function line and select
"SetLineAttributes", then left-click on "Set Parameters". This gives
access to a panel allowing you to interactively change the parameters of
the function, as shown in Figure [2.4](#f24). Change the slit width, or go from one to
two and then three or more slits, just as you like. When clicking on
"Apply", the function plot is updated to reflect the actual value of the
parameters you have set.

{% include figure_image sect=2 fig=5
img="ROOTPanel_FitPanel.png"
caption="Fit Panel."
%}


Another very useful interactive tool is the `FitPanel`, available for the
classes `TGraphErrors` and `TH1F`. Predefined fit functions can be selected
from a pull-down menu, including "`gaus`", "`expo`" and "`pol0`" - "`pol9`"
for Gaussian and exponential functions or polynomials of degree 0 to 9,
respectively. In addition, user-defined functions using the same syntax as
for functions with parameters are possible.

After setting the initial parameters, a fit of the selected function to the
data of a graph or histogram can be performed and the result displayed on the plot.
The fit panel is shown in Figure [2.5](#f25). The fit panel has a number of control options to
select the fit method, fix or release individual parameters in the fit, to steer
the level of output printed on the console, or to extract and display additional
information like contour lines showing parameter correlations. As function fitting
is of prime importance in any kind of data analysis, this topic will again show up
later.

If you are satisfied with your plot, you probably want to save it. Just
close all selector boxes you opened previously and select the menu item
`Save as...` from the menu line of the window. It will pop up a file
selector box to allow you to choose the format, file name and target
directory to store the image. There is one very noticeable feature here:
you can store a plot as a root macro! In this macro, you find the C++
representation of all methods and classes involved in generating the
plot. This is a valuable source of information for your own macros,
which you will hopefully write after having worked through this
tutorial.

Using ROOT's interactive capabilities is useful for a first exploration
of possibilities. Other ROOT classes you will encounter in this tutorial
have such graphical interfaces. We will not comment further on this,
just be aware of the existence of ROOT's interactive features and use
them if you find them convenient. Some trial-and-error is certainly necessary
to find your way through the huge number of menus and parameter
settings.

## ROOT Beginners' FAQ

At this point of the guide, some basic questions could have already come
to your mind. We will try to clarify some of them with further
explanations in the following.

***ROOT type declarations for basic data types***

In the official ROOT documentation, you find special data types
replacing the normal ones, e.g. `Double_t`, `Float_t` or `Int_t`
replacing the standard `double`, `float` or `int` types. Using the ROOT
types makes it easier to port code between platforms (64/32 bit) or
operating systems (windows/Linux), as these types are mapped to suitable
ones in the ROOT header files. If you want adaptive code of this type,
use the ROOT type declarations. However, usually you do not need such
adaptive code, and you can safely use the standard C type declarations
for your private code, as we did and will do throughout this guide. If
you intend to become a ROOT developer, however, you better stick to the
official coding rules!

***Configure ROOT at start-up***

The behaviour of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the
`.rootrc` file. Examples of the tunable parameters are the ones related
to the operating and window system, to the fonts to be used, to the
location of start-up files. At start-up, ROOT looks for a `.rootrc` file
in the following order:

-   `./.rootrc //local directory`

-   `$HOME/.rootrc //user directory`

-   `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc //global ROOT directory`

If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,
the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing
and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class `TEnv`.
Have a look to its documentation if you need such rather advanced
features. The file `.rootrc` defines the location of two rather
important files inspected at start-up: `rootalias.C` and `rootlogon.C`.
They can contain code that needs to be loaded and executed at ROOT
startup. `rootalias.C` is only loaded and best used to define some often
used functions. `rootlogon.C` contains code that will be executed at
startup: this file is extremely useful for example to pre-load a custom
style for the plots created with ROOT. This is done most easily by
creating a new `TStyle` object with your preferred settings, as
described in the class reference guide, and then use the command
`gROOT->SetStyle("MyStyleName");` to make this new style definition the
default one. As an example, have a look in the file `rootlogon.C` coming
with this tutorial. Another relevant file is `rootlogoff.C` that it
called when the session is finished.

***ROOT command history***

Every command typed at the ROOT prompt is stored in a file `.root_hist`
in your home directory. ROOT uses this file to allow for navigation in
the command history with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. It is also
convenient to extract successful ROOT commands with the help of a text
editor for use in your own macros.

***ROOT Global Pointers***

All global pointers in ROOT begin with a small "g". Some of them were
already implicitly introduced (for example in the section
[Configure ROOT at start-up](#configure-root-at-start-up)).
The most important among them are presented in the following:

-   **[gROOT](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTROOT.html)**: the `gROOT`
    variable is the entry point to the ROOT system. Technically it is an
    instance of the `TROOT` class. Using the `gROOT` pointer one has
    access to basically every object created in a ROOT based program.
    The `TROOT` object is essentially a container of several lists
    pointing to the main `ROOT` objects.

-   **[gStyle](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTStyle.html)**: By default
    ROOT creates a default style that can be accessed via the `gStyle`
    pointer. This class includes functions to set some of the following
    object attributes.

    -   Canvas
    -   Pad
    -   Histogram axis
    -   Lines
    -   Fill areas
    -   Text
    -   Markers
    -   Functions
    -   Histogram Statistics and Titles
    -   etc ...

-   **[gSystem](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTSystem.html)**: An
    instance of a base class defining a generic interface to the
    underlying Operating System, in our case `TUnixSystem`.

-   **[gInterpreter](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTInterpreter.html)**: The
    entry point for the ROOT interpreter. Technically an abstraction level
    over a singleton instance of `TCling`.

At this point you have already learned quite a bit about some basic
features of ROOT.

***Please move on to become an expert!***

[^1]: All ROOT classes' names start with the letter T. A notable exception is
RooFit. In this context all classes' names are of the form Roo*.
# ROOT Macros

You know how other books go on and on about programming fundamentals and
finally work up to building a complete, working program ? Let's skip all
that. In this guide, we will describe macros executed by the ROOT C++
interpreter Cling.

It is relatively easy to compile a macro, either as a pre-compiled
library to load into ROOT, or as a stand-alone application, by adding
some include statements for header file or some "dressing code" to any
macro.

## General Remarks on ROOT macros

If you have a number of lines which you were able to execute at the ROOT
prompt, they can be turned into a ROOT macro by giving them a name which
corresponds to the file name without extension. The general structure
for a macro stored in file `MacroName.C` is

{% highlight C++ %}
void MacroName() {
        <          ...
          your lines of C++ code
                   ...             >
}
{% endhighlight %}

The macro is executed by typing

{% highlight C++ %}
 > root MacroName.C
{% endhighlight %}

at the system prompt, or executed using `.x`

{% highlight C++ %}
 > root
 root [0] .x MacroName.C
{% endhighlight %}

at the ROOT prompt. or it can be loaded into a ROOT session and then
be executed by typing

{% highlight C++ %}
root [0].L MacroName.C
root [1] MacroName();
{% endhighlight %}

at the ROOT prompt. Note that more than one macro can be loaded this
way, as each macro has a unique name in the ROOT name space. A small set
of options can help making your plot nicer.

{% highlight C++ %}
gROOT->SetStyle("Plain");   // set plain TStyle
gStyle->SetOptStat(111111); // draw statistics on plots,
                            // (0) for no output
gStyle->SetOptFit(1111);    // draw fit results on plot,
                            // (0) for no ouput
gStyle->SetPalette(57);     // set color map
gStyle->SetOptTitle(0);     // suppress title box
   ...
{% endhighlight %}

Next, you should create a canvas for graphical output, with size,
subdivisions and format suitable to your needs, see documentation of
class `TCanvas`:

{% highlight C++ %}
TCanvas c1("c1","<Title>",0,0,400,300); // create a canvas, specify position and size in pixels
c1.Divide(2,2); //set subdivisions, called pads
c1.cd(1); //change to pad 1 of canvas c1
{% endhighlight %}

These parts of a well-written macro are pretty standard, and you should
remember to include pieces of code like in the examples above to make
sure your plots always look as you had intended.

Below, in section [Interpretation and Compilation](#interpretation-and-compilation), some more code fragments
will be shown, allowing you to use the system compiler to compile macros for
more efficient execution, or turn macros into stand-alone applications linked
against the ROOT libraries.

## A more complete example

Let us now look at a rather complete example of a typical task in data
analysis, a macro that constructs a graph with errors, fits a (linear)
model to it and saves it as an image. To run this macro, simply type in
the shell:

{% highlight C++ %}
 > root macro1.C
{% endhighlight %}

The code is built around the ROOT class `TGraphErrors`, which was
already introduced previously. Have a look at it in the class reference
guide, where you will also find further examples. The macro shown below
uses additional classes, `TF1` to define a function, `TCanvas` to define
size and properties of the window used for our plot, and `TLegend` to
add a nice legend. For the moment, ignore the commented include
statements for header files, they will only become important at the end
in section [Interpretation and Compilation](#interpretation-and-compilation).

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Builds a graph with errors, displays it and saves it as
// image. First, include some header files
// (not necessary for Cling)

#include "TCanvas.h"
#include "TROOT.h"
#include "TGraphErrors.h"
#include "TF1.h"
#include "TLegend.h"
#include "TArrow.h"
#include "TLatex.h"

void macro1(){
    // The values and the errors on the Y axis
    const int n_points=10;
    double x_vals[n_points]=
            {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
    double y_vals[n_points]=
            {6,12,14,20,22,24,35,45,44,53};
    double y_errs[n_points]=
            {5,5,4.7,4.5,4.2,5.1,2.9,4.1,4.8,5.43};

    // Instance of the graph
    TGraphErrors graph(n_points,x_vals,y_vals,nullptr,y_errs);
    graph.SetTitle("Measurement XYZ;lenght [cm];Arb.Units");

    // Make the plot esthetically better
    graph.SetMarkerStyle(kOpenCircle);
    graph.SetMarkerColor(kBlue);
    graph.SetLineColor(kBlue);

    // The canvas on which we'll draw the graph
    auto  mycanvas = new TCanvas();

    // Draw the graph !
    graph.DrawClone("APE");

    // Define a linear function
    TF1 f("Linear law","[0]+x*[1]",.5,10.5);
    // Let's make the function line nicer
    f.SetLineColor(kRed); f.SetLineStyle(2);
    // Fit it to the graph and draw it
    graph.Fit(&f);
    f.DrawClone("Same");

    // Build and Draw a legend
    TLegend leg(.1,.7,.3,.9,"Lab. Lesson 1");
    leg.SetFillColor(0);
    graph.SetFillColor(0);
    leg.AddEntry(&graph,"Exp. Points");
    leg.AddEntry(&f,"Th. Law");
    leg.DrawClone("Same");

    // Draw an arrow on the canvas
    TArrow arrow(8,8,6.2,23,0.02,"|>");
    arrow.SetLineWidth(2);
    arrow.DrawClone();

    // Add some text to the plot
    TLatex text(8.2,7.5,"#splitline{Maximum}{Deviation}");
    text.DrawClone();

    mycanvas->Print("graph_with_law.pdf");
}

int main(){
    macro1();
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Let's comment it in detail:

-   Line *13*: the name of the principal function (it plays the role of
    the "main" function in compiled programs) in the macro file. It has
    to be the same as the file name without extension.

-   Line *24-25*: instance of the `TGraphErrors` class. The constructor
    takes the number of points and the pointers to the arrays of
    x values, y values, x errors (in this case none,
    represented by the NULL pointer) and y errors. The second line
    defines in one shot the title of the graph and the titles of the two
    axes, separated by a ";".

-   Line *28-30*:  These three lines are rather intuitive right ? To understand
    better the enumerators for colors and styles see the reference for
    the `TColor` and `TMarker` classes.

-   Line *33*: the canvas object that will host the drawn objects. The
    "memory leak" is intentional, to make the object existing also out
    of the macro1 scope.

-   Line *36*: the method *DrawClone* draws a clone of the object on the
    canvas. It *has to be* a clone, to survive after the scope of
    `macro1`, and be displayed on screen after the end of the macro
    execution. The string option "APE" stands for:

    -   *A* imposes the drawing of the Axes.

    -   *P* imposes the drawing of the graph's markers.

    -   *E* imposes the drawing of the graph's error bars.

-   Line *39*: define a mathematical function. There are several ways to
    accomplish this, but in this case the constructor accepts the name
    of the function, the formula, and the function range.

-   Line *41*: maquillage. Try to give a look to the line styles at your
    disposal visiting the documentation of the `TLine` class.

-   Line *43*: fits the *f* function to the graph, observe that the
    pointer is passed. It is more interesting to look at the output on
    the screen to see the parameters values and other crucial
    information that we will learn to read at the end of this guide.

-   Line *44*: again draws the clone of the object on the canvas. The
    "Same" option avoids the cancellation of the already drawn objects,
    in our case, the graph. The function *f* will be drawn using the *same* axis
    system defined by the previously drawn graph.

-   Line *47-52*: completes the plot with a legend, represented by a
    `TLegend` instance. The constructor takes as parameters the lower
    left and upper right corners coordinates with respect to the total
    size of the canvas, assumed to be 1, and the legend header string.
    You can add to the legend the objects, previously drawn or not
    drawn, through the `addEntry` method. Observe how the legend is
    drawn at the end: looks familiar now, right ?

-   Line *55-57*: defines an arrow with a triangle on the right hand
    side, a thickness of 2 and draws it.

-   Line *60-61*: interpret a Latex string which has its lower left
    corner located in the specified coordinate. The `#splitline{}{}`
    construct allows to store multiple lines in the same `TLatex`
    object.

-   Line *63*: save the canvas as image. The format is automatically
    inferred from the file extension (it could have been eps, gif, ...).

Let's give a look to the obtained plot in Figure [3.1](#f31). Beautiful
outcome for such a small bunch of lines, isn't it ?

## Summary of Visual effects

***Colors and Graph Markers***

We have seen that to specify a color, some identifiers like kWhite,
kRed or kBlue can be specified for markers, lines, arrows etc. The
complete summary of colors is represented by the ROOT "[color
wheel](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTColor.html#C02)". To know more
about the full story, refer to the online documentation of `TColor`.

ROOT provides several [graphics
markers](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTAttMarker.html#M2) types. Select
the most suited symbols for your plot among dots, triangles, crosses or
stars. An alternative set of names for the markers is available.

***Arrows and Lines***

The macro line *55* shows how to define an arrow and draw it. The class
representing arrows is `TArrow`, which inherits from `TLine`. The
constructors of lines and arrows always contain the coordinates of the
endpoints. Arrows also foresee parameters to [specify
their](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTArrow.html) shapes. Do not
underestimate the role of lines and arrows in your plots. Since each
plot should contain a message, it is convenient to stress it with
additional graphics primitives.

***Text***

Also text plays a fundamental role in making the plots self-explanatory.
A possibility to add text in your plot is provided by the `TLatex`
class. The objects of this class are constructed with the coordinates of
the bottom-left corner of the text and a string which contains the text
itself. The real twist is that ordinary
[Latex mathematical symbols](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTLatex.html#L5)
are automatically interpreted, you just need to replace the "\\" by a "\#".

If
["\\" is used as control character](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTLatex.html#L14)
, then the
[TMathText interface](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTMathText.html)
is invoked. It provides the plain TeX syntax and allow to access character's
set like Russian and Japanese.

## Interpretation and Compilation

As you observed, up to now we heavily exploited the capabilities of ROOT
for interpreting our code, more than compiling and then executing. This
is sufficient for a wide range of applications, but you might have
already asked yourself "how can this code be compiled ?". There are two
answers.

***Compile a Macro with ACLiC***

ACLiC will create for you a compiled dynamic library for your macro,
without any effort from your side, except the insertion of the
appropriate header files in lines *5--11*. In this example, they are
already included. To generate an object library from the macro code, from inside the
interpreter type (please note the "+"):

{% highlight C++ %}
 root [1] .L macro1.C+
{% endhighlight %}

Once this operation is accomplished, the macro symbols will be available
in memory and you will be able to execute it simply by calling from
inside the interpreter:

{% highlight C++ %}
 root [2] macro1()
{% endhighlight %}

***Compile a Macro with the Compiler***

A plethora of excellent compilers are available, both free and
commercial. We will refer to the `GCC` compiler in the following. In
this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and
then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all
the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it
prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with
the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an
entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the
procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into
a stand-alone application is to add the following "dressing code" at the
end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose
of which is to call your macro:

{% highlight C++ %}
int main() {
  ExampleMacro();
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

To create a stand-alone program from a macro called `ExampleMacro.C`, simply type

{% highlight C++ %}
 > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C `root-config --cflags --libs`
{% endhighlight %}

and execute it by typing

{% highlight C++ %}
> ./ExampleMacro
{% endhighlight %}

This procedure will, however, not give access to the ROOT graphics, as
neither control of mouse or keyboard events nor access to the graphics
windows of ROOT is available. If you want your stand-alone application
have display graphics output and respond to mouse and keyboard, a
slightly more complex piece of code can be used. In the example below, a
macro `ExampleMacro_GUI` is executed by the ROOT class `TApplication`. As
a additional feature, this code example offers access to parameters
eventually passed to the program when started from the command line.
Here is the code fragment:

{% highlight C++ %}
void StandaloneApplication(int argc, char** argv) {
  // eventually, evaluate the application parameters argc, argv
  // ==>> here the ROOT macro is called
  ExampleMacro_GUI();
}
  // This is the standard "main" of C++ starting
  // a ROOT application
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   TApplication app("ROOT Application", &argc, argv);
   StandaloneApplication(app.Argc(), app.Argv());
   app.Run();
   return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Compile the code with

{% highlight C++ %}
 > g++ -o ExampleMacro_GUI ExampleMacro_GUI `root-config --cflags --libs`
{% endhighlight %}

and execute the program with

{% highlight C++ %}
> ./ExampleMacro_GUI
{% endhighlight %}


# Graphs

In this Chapter we will learn how to exploit some of the functionalities
ROOT provides to display data exploiting the class `TGraphErrors`,
which you already got to know previously.

## Read Graph Points from File

The fastest way in which you can fill a graph with experimental data is
to use the constructor which reads data points and their errors from an
ASCII file (i.e. standard text) format:

{% highlight C++ %}
TGraphErrors(const char *filename,
const char *format="%lg %lg %lg %lg", Option_t *option="");
{% endhighlight %}

The format string can be:

-   `"%lg %lg"` read only 2 first columns into X,Y

-   `"%lg %lg %lg"` read only 3 first columns into X,Y and EY

-   `"%lg %lg %lg %lg"` read only 4 first columns into X,Y,EX,EY

This approach has the nice feature of allowing the user to reuse the
macro for many different data sets. Here is an example of an input file.
The nice graphic result shown is produced by the macro below, which
reads two such input files and uses different options to display the
data points.

{% highlight C++ %}
# Measurement of Friday 26 March
# Experiment 2 Physics Lab

1   6   5
2   12  5
3   14  4.7
4   20  4.5
5   22  4.2
6   24  5.1
7   35  2.9
8   45  4.1
9   44  4.8
10  53  5.43
{% endhighlight %}


{% include figure_image
img="graph_with_expectation.png"
%}

{% highlight C++ %}
// Reads the points from a file and produces a simple graph.
int macro2(){
    auto c=new TCanvas();c->SetGrid();

    TGraphErrors graph_expected("./macro2_input_expected.txt",
                                "%lg %lg %lg");
    graph_expected.SetTitle(
       "Measurement XYZ and Expectation;"
       "lenght [cm];"
       "Arb.Units");
    graph_expected.SetFillColor(kYellow);
    graph_expected.DrawClone("E3AL"); // E3 draws the band

    TGraphErrors graph("./macro2_input.txt","%lg %lg %lg");
    graph.SetMarkerStyle(kCircle);
    graph.SetFillColor(0);
    graph.DrawClone("PESame");

    // Draw the Legend
    TLegend leg(.1,.7,.3,.9,"Lab. Lesson 2");
    leg.SetFillColor(0);
    leg.AddEntry(&graph_expected,"Expected Points");
    leg.AddEntry(&graph,"Measured Points");
    leg.DrawClone("Same");

    graph.Print();
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In addition to the inspection of the plot, you can check the actual
contents of the graph with the `TGraph::Print()` method at any time,
obtaining a printout of the coordinates of data points on screen. The
macro also shows us how to print a colored band around a graph instead
of error bars, quite useful for example to represent the errors of a
theoretical prediction.

## Polar Graphs

With ROOT you can profit from rather advanced plotting routines, like
the ones implemented in the `TPolarGraph`, a class to draw graphs in
polar coordinates. You can see the example macro in the following and the
resulting Figure is [4.2](#f42):

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Builds a polar graph in a square Canvas.

void macro3(){
    auto c = new TCanvas("myCanvas","myCanvas",600,600);
    Double_t rmin=0.;
    Double_t rmax=TMath::Pi()*6.;
    const Int_t npoints=1000;
    Double_t r[npoints];
    Double_t theta[npoints];
    for (Int_t ipt = 0; ipt < npoints; ipt++) {
        r[ipt] = ipt*(rmax-rmin)/npoints+rmin;
        theta[ipt] = TMath::Sin(r[ipt]);
    }
    TGraphPolar grP1 (npoints,r,theta);
    grP1.SetTitle("A Fan");
    grP1.SetLineWidth(3);
    grP1.SetLineColor(2);
    grP1.DrawClone("L");
}
{% endhighlight %}

A new element was added on line 4, the size of the canvas: it is
sometimes optically better to show plots in specific canvas sizes.

{% include figure_jsroot sect=4 fig=2 width="350px"
file="canvases.root" object="polar_graph"
caption="The graph of a fan obtained with ROOT."
%}

## 2D Graphs

Under specific circumstances, it might be useful to plot some quantities
versus two variables, therefore creating a bi-dimensional graph. Of
course ROOT can help you in this task, with the `TGraph2DErrors` class.
The following macro produces a bi-dimensional graph representing a
hypothetical measurement, fits a bi-dimensional function to it and draws
it together with its x and y projections. Some points of the code will
be explained in detail. This time, the graph is populated with data
points using random numbers, introducing a new and very important
ingredient, the ROOT `TRandom3` random number generator using the
[Mersenne Twister algorithm](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html).

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Create, Draw and fit a TGraph2DErrors
void macro4(){
   gStyle->SetPalette(kBird);
   const double e = 0.3;
   const int nd = 500;

   TRandom3 my_random_generator;
   TF2 f2("f2",
          "1000*(([0]*sin(x)/x)*([1]*sin(y)/y))+200",
          -6,6,-6,6);
   f2.SetParameters(1,1);
   TGraph2DErrors dte(nd);
   // Fill the 2D graph
   double rnd, x, y, z, ex, ey, ez;
   for (Int_t i=0; i<nd; i++) {
      f2.GetRandom2(x,y);
      // A random number in [-e,e]
      rnd = my_random_generator.Uniform(-e,e);
      z = f2.Eval(x,y)*(1+rnd);
      dte.SetPoint(i,x,y,z);
      ex = 0.05*my_random_generator.Uniform();
      ey = 0.05*my_random_generator.Uniform();
      ez = fabs(z*rnd);
      dte.SetPointError(i,ex,ey,ez);
   }
   // Fit function to generated data
   f2.SetParameters(0.7,1.5);  // set initial values for fit
   f2.SetTitle("Fitted 2D function");
   dte.Fit(&f2);
   // Plot the result
   auto c1 = new TCanvas();
   f2.SetLineWidth(1);
   f2.SetLineColor(kBlue-5);
   TF2   *f2c = (TF2*)f2.DrawClone("Surf1");
   TAxis *Xaxis = f2c->GetXaxis();
   TAxis *Yaxis = f2c->GetYaxis();
   TAxis *Zaxis = f2c->GetZaxis();
   Xaxis->SetTitle("X Title"); Xaxis->SetTitleOffset(1.5);
   Yaxis->SetTitle("Y Title"); Yaxis->SetTitleOffset(1.5);
   Zaxis->SetTitle("Z Title"); Zaxis->SetTitleOffset(1.5);
   dte.DrawClone("P0 Same");
   // Make the x and y projections
   auto c_p= new TCanvas("ProjCan",
                         "The Projections",1000,400);
   c_p->Divide(2,1);
   c_p->cd(1);
   dte.Project("x")->Draw();
   c_p->cd(2);
   dte.Project("y")->Draw();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's go through the code, step by step to understand what is going on:

-   Line *3*: This sets the palette color code to a much nicer one than
    the default. Comment this line to give it a try. The color map choice
    must be carefully chosen [^2].

-   Line *7*: The instance of the random generator. You can then draw
    out of this instance random numbers distributed according to
    different probability density functions, like the Uniform one at
    lines *27-29*. See the on-line documentation to appreciate the full
    power of this ROOT feature.

-   Line *8*: You are already familiar with the `TF1` class. This is
    its two-dimensional version. At line *16* two random numbers
    distributed according to the `TF2` formula are drawn with the method
    `TF2::GetRandom2(double& a, double&b)`.

-   Line *27-29*: Fitting a 2-dimensional function just works like in
    the one-dimensional case, i.e. initialisation of parameters and
    calling of the `Fit()` method.

-   Line *34*: The *Surf1* option draws the `TF2` objects (but also
    bi-dimensional histograms) as colored surfaces with a wire-frame on
    three-dimensional canvases. See Figure [4.3](#f43).

-   Line *35-40*: Retrieve the axis pointer and define the axis titles.

-   Line *41*: Draw the cloud of points on top of the colored surface.

-   Line *43-49*: Here you learn how to create a canvas, partition it in
    two sub-pads and access them. It is very handy to show multiple
    plots in the same window or image.

## Multiple graphs

The class `TMultigraph` allows to manipulate a set of graphs as a single entity.
It is a collection of `TGraph` (or derived) objects. When drawn, the X and Y axis
ranges are automatically computed such as all the graphs will be visible.

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Manage several graphs as a single entity.
void multigraph(){
   TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1","multigraph",700,500);
   c1->SetGrid();

   TMultiGraph *mg = new TMultiGraph();

   // create first graph
   const Int_t n1 = 10;
   Double_t px1[] = {-0.1, 0.05, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.61,0.7,0.85,0.89,0.95};
   Double_t py1[] = {-1,2.9,5.6,7.4,9,9.6,8.7,6.3,4.5,1};
   Double_t ex1[] = {.05,.1,.07,.07,.04,.05,.06,.07,.08,.05};
   Double_t ey1[] = {.8,.7,.6,.5,.4,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8};
   TGraphErrors *gr1 = new TGraphErrors(n1,px1,py1,ex1,ey1);
   gr1->SetMarkerColor(kBlue);
   gr1->SetMarkerStyle(21);
   mg->Add(gr1);

   // create second graph
   const Int_t n2 = 10;
   Float_t x2[]  = {-0.28, 0.005, 0.19, 0.29, 0.45, 0.56,0.65,0.80,0.90,1.01};
   Float_t y2[]  = {2.1,3.86,7,9,10,10.55,9.64,7.26,5.42,2};
   Float_t ex2[] = {.04,.12,.08,.06,.05,.04,.07,.06,.08,.04};
   Float_t ey2[] = {.6,.8,.7,.4,.3,.3,.4,.5,.6,.7};
   TGraphErrors *gr2 = new TGraphErrors(n2,x2,y2,ex2,ey2);
   gr2->SetMarkerColor(kRed);
   gr2->SetMarkerStyle(20);
   mg->Add(gr2);

   mg->Draw("apl");
   mg->GetXaxis()->SetTitle("X values");
   mg->GetYaxis()->SetTitle("Y values");

   gPad->Update();
   gPad->Modified();
}
{% endhighlight %}

- Line *6* creates the multigraph.

- Line *9-28*: create two graphs with errors and add them in the multigraph.

- Line *30-32*: draw the multigraph. The axis limits are computed automatically
  to make sure all the graphs' points will be in range.

# Histograms

Histograms play a fundamental role in any type of physics analysis, not
only to visualise measurements but being a powerful form of data
reduction. ROOT offers many classes that represent histograms, all
inheriting from the `TH1` class. We will focus in this chapter on uni-
and bi- dimensional histograms the bin contents of which are represented by
floating point numbers [^3], the `TH1F` and `TH2F` classes respectively.

## Your First Histogram

Let's suppose you want to measure the counts of a Geiger detector located in
proximity of a radioactive source in a given time interval. This would
give you an idea of the activity of your source. The count distribution
in this case is a Poisson distribution. Let's see how operatively you
can fill and draw a histogram with the following example macro.

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Create, Fill and draw an Histogram which reproduces the
// counts of a scaler linked to a Geiger counter.

void macro5(){
    auto cnt_r_h=new TH1F("count_rate",
                "Count Rate;N_{Counts};# occurrence",
                100, // Number of Bins
                -0.5, // Lower X Boundary
                15.5); // Upper X Boundary

    auto mean_count=3.6f;
    TRandom3 rndgen;
    // simulate the measurements
    for (int imeas=0;imeas<400;imeas++)
        cnt_r_h->Fill(rndgen.Poisson(mean_count));

    auto c= new TCanvas();
    cnt_r_h->Draw();

    auto c_norm= new TCanvas();
    cnt_r_h->DrawNormalized();

    // Print summary
    cout << "Moments of Distribution:\n"
         << " - Mean     = " << cnt_r_h->GetMean() << " +- "
                             << cnt_r_h->GetMeanError() << "\n"
         << " - Std Dev  = " << cnt_r_h->GetStdDev() << " +- "
                             << cnt_r_h->GetStdDevError() << "\n"
         << " - Skewness = " << cnt_r_h->GetSkewness() << "\n"
         << " - Kurtosis = " << cnt_r_h->GetKurtosis() << "\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which gives you the following plot (Figure [5.1](#f51)):

file="canvases.root" object="poisson"
caption="The result of a counting (pseudo) experiment. Only bins corresponding
to integer values are filled given the discrete nature of the poissonian

%}


Using histograms is rather simple. The main differences with respect to
graphs that emerge from the example are:

-   line *5*: The histograms have a name and a title right from the
    start, no predefined number of entries but a number of bins and a
    lower-upper range.

-   line *15*: An entry is stored in the histogram through the
    `TH1F::Fill` method.

-   line *18* and *21*: The histogram can be drawn also normalised, ROOT
    automatically takes cares of the necessary rescaling.

-   line *24* to *30*: This small snippet shows how easy it is to access
    the moments and associated errors of a histogram.

## Add and Divide Histograms

Quite a large number of operations can be carried out with histograms.
The most useful are addition and division. In the following macro we
will learn how to manage these procedures within ROOT.

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Divide and add 1D Histograms

void format_h(TH1F* h, int linecolor){
    h->SetLineWidth(3);
    h->SetLineColor(linecolor);
    }

void macro6(){

    auto sig_h=new TH1F("sig_h","Signal Histo",50,0,10);
    auto gaus_h1=new TH1F("gaus_h1","Gauss Histo 1",30,0,10);
    auto gaus_h2=new TH1F("gaus_h2","Gauss Histo 2",30,0,10);
    auto bkg_h=new TH1F("exp_h","Exponential Histo",50,0,10);

    // simulate the measurements
    TRandom3 rndgen;
    for (int imeas=0;imeas<4000;imeas++){
        bkg_h->Fill(rndgen.Exp(4));
        if (imeas%4==0) gaus_h1->Fill(rndgen.Gaus(5,2));
        if (imeas%4==0) gaus_h2->Fill(rndgen.Gaus(5,2));
        if (imeas%10==0)sig_h->Fill(rndgen.Gaus(5,.5));}

    // Format Histograms
    int i=0;
    for (auto hist : {sig_h,bkg_h,gaus_h1,gaus_h2})
        format_h(hist,1+i++);

    // Sum
    auto sum_h= new TH1F(*bkg_h);
    sum_h->Add(sig_h,1.);
    sum_h->SetTitle("Exponential + Gaussian;X variable;Y variable");
    format_h(sum_h,kBlue);

    auto c_sum= new TCanvas();
    sum_h->Draw("hist");
    bkg_h->Draw("SameHist");
    sig_h->Draw("SameHist");

    // Divide
    auto dividend=new TH1F(*gaus_h1);
    dividend->Divide(gaus_h2);

    // Graphical Maquillage
    dividend->SetTitle(";X axis;Gaus Histo 1 / Gaus Histo 2");
    format_h(dividend,kOrange);
    gaus_h1->SetTitle(";;Gaus Histo 1 and Gaus Histo 2");
    gStyle->SetOptStat(0);

    TCanvas* c_divide= new TCanvas();
    c_divide->Divide(1,2,0,0);
    c_divide->cd(1);
    c_divide->GetPad(1)->SetRightMargin(.01);
    gaus_h1->DrawNormalized("Hist");
    gaus_h2->DrawNormalized("HistSame");

    c_divide->cd(2);
    dividend->GetYaxis()->SetRangeUser(0,2.49);
    c_divide->GetPad(2)->SetGridy();
    c_divide->GetPad(2)->SetRightMargin(.01);
    dividend->Draw();
}
{% endhighlight %}

The plots that you will obtain are shown in Figures [5.2](#f52) and [5.3](#f53).

{% include figure_jsroot sect=5 fig=2
file="canvases.root" object="histo_sum"
caption="The sum of two histograms."
%}


{% include figure_jsroot sect=5 fig=3
file="canvases.root" object="histo_ratio"
caption="The ratio of two histograms."
%}


Some lines now need a bit of clarification:

-   line *3*: Cling, as we know, is also able to interpret more than one
    function per file. In this case the function simply sets up some
    parameters to conveniently set the line of histograms.

-   line *19* to *21*: Some `C++` syntax for conditional
    statements is used to fill the histograms with different numbers of
    entries inside the loop.

-   line *30*: The sum of two histograms. A weight, which can be negative, can
    be assigned to the added histogram.

-   line *41*: The division of two histograms is rather straightforward.

-   line *44* to *62*: When you draw two quantities and their ratios, it
    is much better if all the information is condensed in one single
    plot. These lines provide a skeleton to perform this operation.

## Two-dimensional Histograms

Two-dimensional histograms are a very useful tool, for example to
inspect correlations between variables. You can exploit the
bi-dimensional histogram classes provided by ROOT in a simple way.
Let's see how in this macro:

{% highlight C++ %}
// Draw a Bidimensional Histogram in many ways
// together with its profiles and projections

void macro7(){
   gStyle->SetPalette(kBird);
   gStyle->SetOptStat(0);
   gStyle->SetOptTitle(0);

   auto bidi_h = new TH2F("bidi_h","2D Histo;Gaussian Vals;Exp. Vals",
                          30,-5,5,  // X axis
                          30,0,10); // Y axis

   TRandom3 rgen;
   for (int i=0;i<500000;i++) {
      bidi_h->Fill(rgen.Gaus(0,2),10-rgen.Exp(4),.1);
   }

   auto c=new TCanvas("Canvas","Canvas",800,800);
   c->Divide(2,2);
   c->cd(1); bidi_h->Draw("Cont1");
   c->cd(2); bidi_h->Draw("Colz");
   c->cd(3); bidi_h->Draw("Lego2");
   c->cd(4); bidi_h->Draw("Surf3");

   // Profiles and Projections
   auto c2=new TCanvas("Canvas2","Canvas2",800,800);
   c2->Divide(2,2);
   c2->cd(1); bidi_h->ProjectionX()->Draw();
   c2->cd(2); bidi_h->ProjectionY()->Draw();
   c2->cd(3); bidi_h->ProfileX()->Draw();
   c2->cd(4); bidi_h->ProfileY()->Draw();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Two kinds of plots are provided within the code, the first one
containing three-dimensional representations (Figure [5.4](#f54)) and the second one
projections and profiles (Figure [5.5](#f55)) of the bi-dimensional histogram.

{% include figure_image sect=5 fig=4
img="th2f.png"
caption="Different ways of representing bi-dimensional
histograms."
%}


{% include figure_image sect=5 fig=5
img="proj_and_prof.png"
caption="The projections and profiles of bi-dimensional
histograms."
%}


When a projection is performed along the x (y) direction, for every bin
along the x (y) axis, all bin contents along the y (x) axis are summed
up (upper the plots of Figure [5.5](#f55)). When a profile is performed along the x (y)
direction, for every bin along the x (y) axis, the average of all the
bin contents along the y (x) is calculated together with their RMS and
displayed as a symbol with error bar (lower two plots of Figure [5.5](#f55)).

Correlations between the variables are quantified by the methods
`Double_t GetCovariance()` and `Double_t GetCorrelationFactor()`.



## Multiple histograms

The class `THStack` allows to manipulate a set of histograms as a single entity.
It is a collection of `TH1` (or derived) objects. When drawn, the X and Y axis
ranges are automatically computed such as all the histograms will be visible.
Several drawing option are available for both 1D and 2D histograms. The next
macros shows how it looks for 2D histograms:

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Example of stacked histograms using the class THStack

void hstack(){
   THStack *a = new THStack("a","Stacked 2D histograms");

   TF2 *f1 = new TF2("f1","xygaus + xygaus(5) + xylandau(10)",-4,4,-4,4);
   Double_t params1[] = {130,-1.4,1.8,1.5,1, 150,2,0.5,-2,0.5, 3600,-2,0.7,-3,0.3};
   f1->SetParameters(params1);
   TH2F *h2sta = new TH2F("h2sta","h2sta",20,-4,4,20,-4,4);
   h2sta->SetFillColor(38);
   h2sta->FillRandom("f1",4000);

   TF2 *f2 = new TF2("f2","xygaus + xygaus(5)",-4,4,-4,4);
   Double_t params2[] = {100,-1.4,1.9,1.1,2, 80,2,0.7,-2,0.5};
   f2->SetParameters(params2);
   TH2F *h2stb = new TH2F("h2stb","h2stb",20,-4,4,20,-4,4);
   h2stb->SetFillColor(46);
   h2stb->FillRandom("f2",3000);

   a->Add(h2sta);
   a->Add(h2stb);

   a->Draw();
}
{% endhighlight %}

- Line *4*: creates the stack.

- Lines *4-18*: create two histograms to be added in the stack.

- Lines *20-21*: add the histograms in the stack.

- Line *23*: draws the stack as a lego plot. The color distinguish the two histograms [5.6](#f56).

# Functions and Parameter Estimation

After going through the previous chapters, you already know how to use
analytical functions (class `TF1`), and you got some insight into the
graph (`TGraphErrors`) and histogram classes (`TH1F`) for data
visualisation. In this chapter we will add more detail to the previous
approximate explanations to face the fundamental topic of parameter
estimation by fitting functions to data. For graphs and histograms, ROOT
offers an easy-to-use interface to perform fits - either the fit panel
of the graphical interface, or the `Fit` method. The class `TFitResult`
allows access to the detailed results.

Very often it is necessary to study the statistical properties of
analysis procedures. This is most easily achieved by applying the
analysis to many sets of simulated data (or "pseudo data"), each
representing one possible version of the true experiment. If the
simulation only deals with the final distributions observed in data, and
does not perform a full simulation of the underlying physics and the
experimental apparatus, the name "Toy Monte Carlo" is frequently used
[^4]. Since the true values of all parameters are known in the
pseudo-data, the differences between the parameter estimates from the
analysis procedure w.r.t. the true values can be determined, and it is
also possible to check that the analysis procedure provides correct
error estimates.

## Fitting Functions to Pseudo Data

In the example below, a pseudo-data set is produced and a model fitted
to it.

ROOT offers various minimisation algorithms to minimise a chi2 or a
negative log-likelihood function. The default minimiser is MINUIT, a
package originally implemented in the FORTRAN programming language. A
C++ version is also available, MINUIT2, as well as [Fumili](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTFumili.html) an
algorithm optimised for fitting. The
minimisation algorithms can be selected using the static functions of
the `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions` class. Steering options for the
minimiser, such as the convergence tolerance or the maximum number of
function calls, can also be set using the methods of this class. All
currently implemented minimisers are documented in the reference
documentation of ROOT: have a look for example to the
`ROOT::Math::Minimizer` class documentation.

The complication level of the code below is intentionally a little
higher than in the previous examples. The graphical output of the macro
is shown in Figure [6.1](#f61):

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
void format_line(TAttLine* line,int col,int sty){
    line->SetLineWidth(5); line->SetLineColor(col);
    line->SetLineStyle(sty);}

double the_gausppar(double* vars, double* pars){
    return pars[0]*TMath::Gaus(vars[0],pars[1],pars[2])+
        pars[3]+pars[4]*vars[0]+pars[5]*vars[0]*vars[0];}

    TF1 parabola("parabola","[0]+[1]*x+[2]*x**2",0,20);
    format_line(&parabola,kBlue,2);

    format_line(&gaussian,kRed,2);

    TF1 gausppar("gausppar",the_gausppar,-0,20,6);
    double a=15; double b=-1.2; double c=.03;
    double norm=4; double mean=7; double sigma=1;
    gausppar.SetParameters(norm,mean,sigma,a,b,c);
    gausppar.SetParNames("Norm","Mean","Sigma","a","b","c");
    format_line(&gausppar,kBlue,1);

    TH1F histo("histo","Signal plus background;X vals;Y Vals",50,0,20);
    histo.SetMarkerStyle(8);

    // Fake the data
    for (int i=1;i<=5000;++i) histo.Fill(gausppar.GetRandom());

    // Reset the parameters before the fit and set
    // by eye a peak at 6 with an area of more or less 50
    gausppar.SetParameter(0,50);
    gausppar.SetParameter(1,6);
    int npar=gausppar.GetNpar();
    for (int ipar=2;ipar<npar;++ipar) gausppar.SetParameter(ipar,1);

    // perform fit ...
    auto fitResPtr = histo.Fit(&gausppar, "S");
    // ... and retrieve fit results
    fitResPtr->Print(); // print fit results
    // get covariance Matrix an print it
    TMatrixDSym covMatrix (fitResPtr->GetCovarianceMatrix());
    covMatrix.Print();

    // Set the values of the gaussian and parabola
    for (int ipar=0;ipar<3;ipar++){
        gaussian.SetParameter(ipar,gausppar.GetParameter(ipar));
        parabola.SetParameter(ipar,gausppar.GetParameter(ipar+3));
    }

    histo.GetYaxis()->SetRangeUser(0,250);
    histo.DrawClone("PE");
    parabola.DrawClone("Same"); gaussian.DrawClone("Same");
    TLatex latex(2,220,"#splitline{Signal Peak over}{background}");
    latex.DrawClone("Same");
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Some step by step explanation is at this point necessary:

-   Lines *1-3*: A simple function to ease the make-up of lines.
    Remember that the class `TF1` inherits from `TAttLine`.

-   Lines *5-7* : Definition of a customised function, namely a Gaussian
    (the "signal") plus a parabolic function, the "background".

-   Lines *10-12*: Some make-up for the Canvas. In particular we want
    that the parameters of the fit appear very clearly and nicely on the
    plot.

-   Lines *20-25*: Define and initialise an instance of `TF1`.

-   Lines *27-31*: Define and fill a histogram.

-   Lines *33-38*: For convenience, the same function as for the
    generation of the pseudo-data is used in the fit; hence, we need to
    reset the function parameters. This part of the code is very
    important for each fit procedure, as it sets the initial values of
    the fit.

-   Line *41*: A very simple command, well known by now: fit the
    function to the histogram.

-   Lines *42-46*: Retrieve the output from the fit. Here, we simply
    print the fit result and access and print the covariance matrix of
    the parameters.

-   Lines *54-end*: Plot the pseudo-data, the fitted function and the
    signal and background components at the best-fit values.

## Toy Monte Carlo Experiments

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two
methods to fit a function to a histogram, the  $\chi^{2}$

method and a method called "binned log-likelihood fit", both available in ROOT.

As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit
results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called "pull", the
difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,
normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,
$\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the
distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.
a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one.

The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a
histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,
representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is
performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated
and filled into a histogram. Here is the code:

{% highlight C++ linenos %}
// Toy Monte Carlo example.
// Check pull distribution to compare chi2 and binned
// log-likelihood methods.

void pull( int n_toys = 10000,
      int n_tot_entries = 100,
      int nbins = 40,
      bool do_chi2=true ){

    TString method_prefix("Log-Likelihood ");
    if (do_chi2)
        method_prefix="#chi^{2} ";

    // Create histo
    TH1F h4(method_prefix+"h4",
            method_prefix+" Random Gauss",
            nbins,-4,4);
    h4.SetMarkerStyle(21);
    h4.SetMarkerSize(0.8);
    h4.SetMarkerColor(kRed);

    // Histogram for sigma and pull
    TH1F sigma(method_prefix+"sigma",
               method_prefix+"sigma from gaus fit",
               50,0.5,1.5);
    TH1F pull(method_prefix+"pull",
              method_prefix+"pull from gaus fit",
              50,-4.,4.);

    // Make nice canvases
    auto c0 = new TCanvas(method_prefix+"Gauss",
                          method_prefix+"Gauss",0,0,320,240);
    c0->SetGrid();

    // Make nice canvases
    auto c1 = new TCanvas(method_prefix+"Result",
                          method_prefix+"Sigma-Distribution",
                          0,300,600,400);
    c0->cd();

    float sig, mean;
    for (int i=0; i<n_toys; i++){
     // Reset histo contents
        h4.Reset();
     // Fill histo
        for ( int j = 0; j<n_tot_entries; j++ )
        h4.Fill(gRandom->Gaus());
     // perform fit
        if (do_chi2) h4.Fit("gaus","q"); // Chi2 fit
        else h4.Fit("gaus","lq"); // Likelihood fit
     // some control output on the way
        if (!(i%100)){
            h4.Draw("ep");
            c0->Update();}

     // Get sigma from fit
        TF1 *fit = h4.GetFunction("gaus");
        sig = fit->GetParameter(2);
        mean= fit->GetParameter(1);
        sigma.Fill(sig);
        pull.Fill(mean/sig * sqrt(n_tot_entries));
       } // end of toy MC loop
     // print result
        c1->cd();
        pull.DrawClone();
}

void macro9(){
    int n_toys=10000;
    int n_tot_entries=100;
    int n_bins=40;
    cout << "Performing Pull Experiment with chi2 \n";
    pull(n_toys,n_tot_entries,n_bins,true);
    cout << "Performing Pull Experiment with Log Likelihood\n";
    pull(n_toys,n_tot_entries,n_bins,false);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Your present knowledge of ROOT should be enough to understand all the
technicalities behind the macro. Note that the variable `pull` in line
*61* is different from the definition above: instead of the parameter
error on `mean`, the fitted standard deviation of the distribution
divided by the square root of the number of entries,
`sig/sqrt(n_tot_entries)`, is used.

-   What method exhibits the better performance with the default
    parameters ?

-   What happens if you increase the number of entries per histogram by
    a factor of ten ? Why ?

The answers to these questions are well beyond the scope of this guide.
Basically all books about statistical methods provide a complete
treatment of the aforementioned topics.

[^4]: "Monte Carlo" simulation means that random numbers play a role here
which is as crucial as in games of pure chance in the Casino of Monte Carlo.
# File I/O and Parallel Analysis

## Storing ROOT Objects

ROOT offers the possibility to write instances of classes on
disk, into a *ROOT-file* (see the `TFile` class for more details).
One says that the object is made "persistent" by storing
it on disk. When reading the file back, the object is reconstructed
in memory. The requirement to be satisfied to perform I/O of instances
of a certain class is that the ROOT type system is aware of the layout
in memory of that class.
This topic is beyond the scope of this document: it is worth to mention
that I/O can be performed out of the box for the almost complete set
of ROOT classes.

We can explore this functionality with histograms and two simple macros.

{% highlight C++ %}
void write_to_file(){

    // Instance of our histogram
    TH1F h("my_histogram","My Title;X;# of entries",100,-5,5);

    // Let's fill it randomly
    h.FillRandom("gaus");

    // Let's open a TFile
    TFile out_file("my_rootfile.root","RECREATE");

    // Write the histogram in the file
    h.Write();

    // Close the file
    out_file.Close();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Not bad, eh ? Especially for a language that does not foresee
persistence natively like C++. The *RECREATE* option forces ROOT to
create a new file even if a file with the same name exists on disk.

Now, you may use the Cling command line to access information in the file
and draw the previously written histogram:

{% highlight C++ %}
>  root my_rootfile.root
root [0]
Attaching file my_rootfile.root as _file0...
root [1] _file0->ls()
TFile**     my_rootfile.root
 TFile*     my_rootfile.root
  KEY: TH1F	my_histogram;1 My Title
root [2] my_histogram->Draw()
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, you can use a simple macro to carry out the job:

{% highlight C++ %}

## N-tuples in ROOT

***Storing simple N-tuples***

Up to now we have seen how to manipulate input read from ASCII files.
ROOT offers the possibility to do much better than that, with its own
n-tuple classes. Among the many advantages provided by these classes one
could cite

-   Optimised disk I/O.

-   Possibility to store many n-tuple rows.

-   Write the n-tuples in ROOT files.

-   Interactive inspection with `TBrowser`.

-   Store not only numbers, but also *objects* in the columns.

In this section we will discuss briefly the `TNtuple` class, which is a
simplified version of the `TTree` class. A ROOT `TNtuple` object can
store rows of float entries. Let's tackle the problem according to the
usual strategy commenting a minimal example

{% highlight C++ %}
// Fill an n-tuple and write it to a file simulating measurement of
// conductivity of a material in different conditions of pressure
// and temperature.

void write_ntuple_to_file(){

   TFile ofile("conductivity_experiment.root","RECREATE");

   // Initialise the TNtuple
   TNtuple cond_data("cond_data",
                     "Example N-Tuple",
                     "Potential:Current:Temperature:Pressure");

   // Fill it randomly to fake the acquired data
   TRandom3 rndm;
   float pot,cur,temp,pres;
   for (int i=0;i<10000;++i){
      pot=rndm.Uniform(0.,10.);      // get voltage
      temp=rndm.Uniform(250.,350.);  // get temperature
      pres=rndm.Uniform(0.5,1.5);    // get pressure
      cur=pot/(10.+0.05*(temp-300.)-0.2*(pres-1.)); // current
                                                    // add some random smearing (measurement errors)
      pot*=rndm.Gaus(1.,0.01); // 1% error on voltage
      temp+=rndm.Gaus(0.,0.3); // 0.3 abs. error on temp.
      pres*=rndm.Gaus(1.,0.02);// 1% error on pressure
      cur*=rndm.Gaus(1.,0.01); // 1% error on current
                               // write to ntuple
      cond_data.Fill(pot,cur,temp,pres);
   }

   // Save the ntuple and close the file
   cond_data.Write();
   ofile.Close();
}
{% endhighlight %}

This data written to this example n-tuple represents, in the statistical
sense, three independent variables (Potential or Voltage, Pressure and
Temperature), and one variable (Current) which depends on the others
according to very simple laws, and an additional Gaussian smearing. This
set of variables mimics a measurement of an electrical resistance while
varying pressure and temperature.

Imagine your task now consists in finding the relations among the
variables -- of course without knowing the code used to generate them.
You will see that the possibilities of the `NTuple` class enable you to
perform this analysis task. Open the ROOT file (`cond_data.root`)
written by the macro above in an interactive session and use a
`TBrowser` to interactively inspect it:

{% highlight C++ %}
root[0] TBrowser b
{% endhighlight %}
You find the columns of your n-tuple written as *leafs*. Simply clicking
on them you can obtain histograms of the variables!

Next, try the following commands at the shell prompt and in the
interactive ROOT shell, respectively:

{% highlight C++ %}
> root conductivity_experiment.root
Attaching file conductivity_experiment.root as _file0...
root [0] cond_data->Draw("Current:Potential")
{% endhighlight %}

You just produced a correlation plot with one single line of code!

Try to extend the syntax typing for example

{% highlight C++ %}
root [1] cond_data->Draw("Current:Potential","Temperature<270")
{% endhighlight %}

What do you obtain ?

Now try

{% highlight C++ %}
root [2] cond_data->Draw("Current/Potential:Temperature")
{% endhighlight %}

It should have become clear from these examples how to navigate in such
a multi-dimensional space of variables and unveil relations between
variables using n-tuples.

***Reading N-tuples***

For completeness, you find here a small macro to read the data back from
a ROOT n-tuple

{% highlight C++ %}
// Read the previously produced N-Tuple and print on screen
// its content

void read_ntuple_from_file(){

    // Open a file, save the ntuple and close the file
    TFile in_file("conductivity_experiment.root");
    TNtuple* my_tuple;in_file.GetObject("cond_data",my_tuple);
    float pot,cur,temp,pres; float* row_content;

    cout << "Potential\tCurrent\tTemperature\tPressure\n";
    for (int irow=0;irow<my_tuple->GetEntries();++irow){
        my_tuple->GetEntry(irow);
        row_content = my_tuple->GetArgs();
        pot = row_content[0];
        cur = row_content[1];
        temp = row_content[2];
        pres = row_content[3];
        cout << pot << "\t" << cur << "\t" << temp
             << "\t" << pres << endl;
        }

    }
{% endhighlight %}

The macro shows the easiest way of accessing the content of a n-tuple:
after loading the n-tuple, its branches are assigned to variables and
`GetEntry(long)` automatically fills them with the content for a
specific row. By doing so, the logic for reading the n-tuple and the
code to process it can be split and the source code remains clear.

***Storing Arbitrary N-tuples***

It is also possible to write n-tuples of arbitrary type by using ROOT's
`TBranch` class. This is especially important as `TNtuple::Fill()`
accepts only floats. The following macro creates the same n-tuple as
before but the branches are booked directly. The `Fill()` function then
fills the current values of the connected variables to the tree.

{% highlight C++ %}
// Fill an n-tuple and write it to a file simulating measurement of
// conductivity of a material in different conditions of pressure
// and temperature using branches.

void write_ntuple_to_file_advanced(
   const std::string& outputFileName="conductivity_experiment.root"
   ,unsigned int numDataPoints=1000000){

   TFile ofile(outputFileName.c_str(),"RECREATE");

   // Initialise the TNtuple
   TTree cond_data("cond_data", "Example N-Tuple");

   // define the variables and book them for the ntuple
   float pot,cur,temp,pres;
   cond_data.Branch("Potential", &pot, "Potential/F");
   cond_data.Branch("Current", &cur, "Current/F");
   cond_data.Branch("Temperature", &temp, "Temperature/F");
   cond_data.Branch("Pressure", &pres, "Pressure/F");

   for (int i=0;i<numDataPoints;++i){
      // Fill it randomly to fake the acquired data
      pot=gRandom->Uniform(0.,10.)*gRandom->Gaus(1.,0.01);
      temp=gRandom->Uniform(250.,350.)+gRandom->Gaus(0.,0.3);
      pres=gRandom->Uniform(0.5,1.5)*gRandom->Gaus(1.,0.02);
      cur=pot/(10.+0.05*(temp-300.)-0.2*(pres-1.))*
                    gRandom->Gaus(1.,0.01);
      // write to ntuple
      cond_data.Fill();}

   // Save the ntuple and close the file
   cond_data.Write();
   ofile.Close();
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `Branch()` function requires a pointer to a variable and a
definition of the variable type. The following table lists some of the possible
values.
Please note that ROOT is not checking the input and mistakes are likely
to result in serious problems. This holds especially if values are read
as another type than they have been written, e.g. when storing a
variable as float and reading it as double.

List of variable types that can be used to define the type of a branch in ROOT:

```
  type               size     C++             identifier
  ------------------ -------- --------------- ------------
  signed integer     32 bit   int             I
                     64 bit   long            L
  unsigned integer   32 bit   unsigned int    i
                     64 bit   unsigned long   l
  floating point     32 bit   float           F
                     64 bit   double          D
  boolean            -        bool            O
```

***Processing N-tuples Spanning over Several Files***

Usually n-tuples or trees span over many files and it would be difficult
to add them manually. ROOT thus kindly provides a helper class in the
form of `TChain`. Its usage is shown in the following macro which is
very similar to the previous example. The constructor of a `TChain`
takes the name of the `TTree` (or `TNuple`) as an argument. The files
are added with the function `Add(fileName)`, where one can also use
wild-cards as shown in the example.

{% highlight C++ %}
// Read several previously produced N-Tuples and print on screen its
// content.
//
// you can easily create some files with the following statement:
//
// for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5; \\
// do root -l -x -b -q \\
// "write_ntuple_to_file.cxx \\
// (\"conductivity_experiment_${i}.root\", 100)"; \\
//  done

void read_ntuple_with_chain(){
   // initiate a TChain with the name of the TTree to be processed
   TChain in_chain("cond_data");
   in_chain.Add("conductivity_experiment*.root"); // add files,
                                                  // wildcards work

   // define variables and assign them to the corresponding branches
   float pot, cur, temp, pres;
   in_chain.SetBranchAddress("Potential", &pot);
   in_chain.SetBranchAddress("Current", &cur);
   in_chain.SetBranchAddress("Temperature", &temp);
   in_chain.SetBranchAddress("Pressure", &pres);

   cout << "Potential\tCurrent\tTemperature\tPressure\n";
   for (size_t irow=0; irow<in_chain.GetEntries(); ++irow){
      in_chain.GetEntry(irow); // loads all variables that have
                                    // been connected to branches
      cout << pot << "\t" << cur << "\t" << temp <<
                          "\t" << pres << endl;
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

***For the advanced user: Processing trees with a selector script***


Another very general and powerful way of processing a `TChain` is
provided via the method `TChain::Process()`. This method takes as
arguments an instance of a -- user-implemented-- class of type
`TSelector`, and -- optionally -- the number of entries and the first
entry to be processed. A template for the class `TSelector` is provided
by the method `TTree::MakeSelector`, as is shown in the little macro
`makeSelector.C` below.

It opens the n-tuple `conductivity_experiment.root` from the example
above and creates from it the header file `MySelector.h` and a template
to insert your own analysis code, `MySelector.C`.


{% highlight C++ %}
{
// create template class for Selector to run on a tree
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// open root file containing the Tree
    TFile f("conductivity_experiment.root");
// create TTree object from it
    TTree *t; f.GetObject("cond_data",t);
// this generates the files MySelector.h and MySelector.C
    t->MakeSelector("MySelector");
}
{% endhighlight %}

The template contains the entry points `Begin()` and `SlaveBegin()`
called before processing of the `TChain` starts, `Process()` called for
every entry of the chain, and `SlaveTerminate()` and `Terminate()`
called after the last entry has been processed. Typically,
initialization like booking of histograms is performed in
`SlaveBegin()`, the analysis, i.e. the selection of entries,
calculations and filling of histograms, is done in `Process()`, and
final operations like plotting and storing of results happen in
`SlaveTerminate()` or `Terminate()`.

The entry points `SlaveBegin()` and `SlaveTerminate()` are called on
so-called slave nodes only if parallel processing via `PROOF` or
`PROOF lite` is enabled, as will be explained below.

A simple example of a selector class is shown in the macro
`MySelector.C`. The example is executed with the following sequence of
commands:

{% highlight C++ %}
> TChain *ch=new TChain("cond_data", "Chain for Example N-Tuple");
> ch->Add("conductivity_experiment*.root");
> ch->Process("MySelector.C+");
{% endhighlight %}

As usual, the "`+`" appended to the name of the macro to be executed
initiates the compilation of the `MySelector.C` with the system compiler
in order to improve performance.

The code in `MySelector.C`, shown in the listing below, books some
histograms in `SlaveBegin()` and adds them to the instance `fOutput`,
which is of the class `TList` [^5]. The final processing in
`Terminate()` allows to access histograms and store, display or save
them as pictures. This is shown in the example via the `TList`
`fOutput`. See the commented listing below for more details; most of the
text is actually comments generated automatically by
`TTree::MakeSelector`.

{% highlight C++ %}
#define MySelector_cxx
// The class definition in MySelector.h has been generated automatically
// by the ROOT utility TTree::MakeSelector(). This class is derived
// from the ROOT class TSelector. For more information on the TSelector
// framework see $ROOTSYS/README/README.SELECTOR or the ROOT User Manual.

// The following methods are defined in this file:
//    Begin():        called every time a loop on the tree starts,
//                    a convenient place to create your histograms.
//    SlaveBegin():   called after Begin(), when on PROOF called only on the
//                    slave servers.
//    Process():      called for each event, in this function you decide what
//                    to read and fill your histograms.
//    SlaveTerminate: called at the end of the loop on the tree, when on PROOF
//                    called only on the slave servers.
//    Terminate():    called at the end of the loop on the tree,
//                    a convenient place to draw/fit your histograms.
//
// To use this file, try the following session on your Tree T:
//
// root> T->Process("MySelector.C")
// root> T->Process("MySelector.C","some options")
// root> T->Process("MySelector.C+")
//

#include "MySelector.h"
#include <TH2.h>
#include <TStyle.h>


void MySelector::Begin(TTree * /*tree*/)
{
   // The Begin() function is called at the start of the query.
   // When running with PROOF Begin() is only called on the client.
   // The tree argument is deprecated (on PROOF 0 is passed).

   TString option = GetOption();

}

void MySelector::SlaveBegin(TTree * /*tree*/)
{
   // The SlaveBegin() function is called after the Begin() function.
   // When running with PROOF SlaveBegin() is called on each slave server.
   // The tree argument is deprecated (on PROOF 0 is passed).

   TString option = GetOption();

}

Bool_t MySelector::Process(Long64_t entry)
{
   // The Process() function is called for each entry in the tree (or possibly
   // keyed object in the case of PROOF) to be processed. The entry argument
   // specifies which entry in the currently loaded tree is to be processed.
   // It can be passed to either MySelector::GetEntry() or TBranch::GetEntry()
   // to read either all or the required parts of the data. When processing
   // keyed objects with PROOF, the object is already loaded and is available
   // via the fObject pointer.
   //
   // This function should contain the "body" of the analysis. It can contain
   // simple or elaborate selection criteria, run algorithms on the data
   // of the event and typically fill histograms.
   //
   // The processing can be stopped by calling Abort().
   //
   // Use fStatus to set the return value of TTree::Process().
   //
   // The return value is currently not used.

   return kTRUE;
}

void MySelector::SlaveTerminate()
{
   // The SlaveTerminate() function is called after all entries or objects
   // have been processed. When running with PROOF SlaveTerminate() is called
   // on each slave server.

}

void MySelector::Terminate()
{
   // The Terminate() function is the last function to be called during
   // a query. It always runs on the client, it can be used to present
   // the results graphically or save the results to file.

}
{% endhighlight %}

***For power-users: Multi-core processing with `PROOF lite`***


The processing of n-tuples via a selector function of type `TSelector`
through `TChain::Process()`, as described at the end of the previous
section, offers an additional advantage in particular for very large
data sets: on distributed systems or multi-core architectures, portions
of data can be processed in parallel, thus significantly reducing the
execution time. On modern computers with multi-core CPUs or
hardware-threading enabled, this allows a much faster turnaround of
analyses, since all the available CPU power is used.

On distributed systems, a PROOF server and worker nodes have to be set
up, as described in detail in the ROOT documentation. On a single
computer with multiple cores, `PROOF lite` can be used instead. Try the
following little macro, `RunMySelector.C`, which contains two extra
lines compared to the example above (adjust the number of workers
according to the number of CPU cores):

{% highlight C++ %}
{// set up a TChain
TChain *ch=new TChain("cond_data", "My Chain for Example N-Tuple");
 ch->Add("conductivity_experiment*.root");
// eventually, start Proof Lite on cores
TProof::Open("workers=4");
ch->SetProof();
ch->Process("MySelector.C+");}
{% endhighlight %}

The first command, `TProof::Open(const char*)` starts a local PROOF
server (if no arguments are specified, all cores will be used), and the
command `ch->SetProof();` enables processing of the chain using PROOF.
Now, when issuing the command `ch->Process("MySelector.C+);`, the code
in `MySelector.C` is compiled and executed on each slave node. The
methods `Begin()` and `Terminate()` are executed on the master only. The
list of n-tuple files is analysed, and portions of the data are assigned
to the available slave processes. Histograms booked in `SlaveBegin()`
exist in the processes on the slave nodes, and are filled accordingly.
Upon termination, the PROOF master collects the histograms from the
slaves and merges them. In `Terminate()` all merged histograms are
available and can be inspected, analysed or stored. The histograms are
handled via the instances `fOutput` of class `TList` in each slave
process, and can be retrieved from this list after merging in
`Terminate`.

To explore the power of this mechanism, generate some very large
n-tuples using the script from the section
[Storing Arbitrary N-tuples](#storing-arbitrary-n-tuples) -
you could try 10 000 000 events (this
results in a large n-tuple of about 160 MByte in size). You could also
generate a large number of files and use wildcards to add the to the
`TChain`. Now execute: `> root -l RunMySelector.C` and watch what
happens:

{% highlight C++ %}
Processing RunMySelector.C...

{% endhighlight %}

Log files of the whole processing chain are kept in the directory
`~.proof` for each worker node. This is very helpful for debugging or if
something goes wrong. As the method described here also works without
using PROOF, the development work on an analysis script can be done in
the standard way on a small subset of the data, and only for the full
processing one would use parallelism via PROOF.

It is worth to remind the reader that the speed of typical data analysis
programs limited by the I/O speed (for example the latencies implied by
reading data from a hard drive). It is therefore expected that this
limitation cannot be eliminated with the usage of any parallel analysis
toolkit.

***Optimisation Regarding N-tuples***

ROOT automatically applies compression algorithms on n-tuples to reduce
the memory consumption. A value that is in most cases the same will
consume only small space on your disk (but it has to be decompressed on
reading). Nevertheless, you should think about the design of your
n-tuples and your analyses as soon as the processing time exceeds some
minutes.

-   Try to keep your n-tuples simple and use appropriate variable types.
    If your measurement has only a limited precision, it is needless to
    store it with double precision.

-   Experimental conditions that do not change with every single
    measurement should be stored in a separate tree. Although the
    compression can handle redundant values, the processing time
    increase with every variable that has to be filled.

-   The function `SetCacheSize(long)` specifies the size of the cache
    for reading a `TTree` object from a file. The default value is 30MB.
    A manual increase may help in certain situations. Please note that
    the caching mechanism can cover only one `TTree` object per `TFile`
    object.

-   You can select the branches to be covered by the caching algorithm
    with `AddBranchToCache` and deactivate unneeded branches with
    `SetBranchStatus`. This mechanism can result in a significant
    speed-up for simple operations on trees with many branches.

-   You can measure the performance easily with `TTreePerfStats`. The
    ROOT documentation on this class also includes an introductory
    example. For example, `TTreePerfStats` can show you that it is
    beneficial to store meta data and payload data separately, i.e.
    write the meta data tree in a bulk to a file at the end of your job
    instead of writing both trees interleaved.

[^5]: The usage of `fOutput` is not really needed for this simple example, but it allows re-usage of the exact code in parallel processing with `PROOF` (see next section).

# ROOT in Python

ROOT offers the possibility to interface to Python via a set of bindings called
PyROOT.
Python is used in a wide variety of application areas and one of the most used
scripting languages today.
With the help of PyROOT it becomes possible to combine the power of a scripting
language with ROOT tools. Introductory material to Python is available from many
sources on the web, see e. g. http://docs.python.org.

## PyROOT

The access to ROOT classes and their methods in PyROOT is almost identical to C++
macros, except for the special language features of Python, most importantly dynamic
type declaration at the time of assignment. Coming back to our first example, simply
plotting a function in ROOT, the following C++ code:

{% highlight C++ %}
TF1 *f1 = new TF1("f2","[0]*sin([1]*x)/x",0.,10.);
f1->SetParameter(0,1);
f1->SetParameter(1,1);
f1->Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

in Python becomes:

{% highlight python %}
import ROOT
f1 = ROOT.TF1("f2","[0]*sin([1]*x)/x",0.,10.)
f1.SetParameter(0,1);
f1.SetParameter(1,1);
f1.Draw();
{% endhighlight %}

A slightly more advanced example hands over data defined in the macro to the ROOT
class `TGraphErrors`. Note that a Python array can be used to pass data between
Python and ROOT. The first line in the Python script allows it to be executed
directly from the operating system, without the need to start the script from
python or the highly recommended powerful interactive shell ipython. The last line
in the python script is there to allow you to have a look at the graphical output
in the ROOT canvas before it disappears upon termination of the script.

Here is the C++ version:

{% highlight C++ %}
void TGraphFit(){
   //
   // Draw a graph with error bars and fit a function to it
   //
   gStyle->SetOptFit(111) ; //superimpose fit results
   // make nice Canvas
   TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1" ,"Daten" ,200 ,10 ,700 ,500) ;
   c1->SetGrid( ) ;
   //define some data points ...
   const Int_t n = 10;
   Float_t x[n] = {-0.22, 0.1, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.61, 0.7, 0.85, 0.89, 1.1};
   Float_t y[n] = {0.7, 2.9, 5.6, 7.4, 9., 9.6, 8.7, 6.3, 4.5, 1.1};
   Float_t ey[n] = {.8 ,.7 ,.6 ,.5 ,.4 ,.4 ,.5 ,.6 ,.7 ,.8};
   Float_t ex[n] = {.05 ,.1 ,.07 ,.07 ,.04 ,.05 ,.06 ,.07 ,.08 ,.05};
   // and hand over to TGraphErros object
   TGraphErrors *gr = new TGraphErrors(n,x,y,ex,ey);
   gr->SetTitle("TGraphErrors with Fit") ;
   gr->Draw("AP");
   // now perform a fit (with errors in x and y!)
   gr->Fit("gaus");
   c1->Update();
}
{% endhighlight %}

In Python it looks like this:

{% highlight python %}
#
# Draw a graph with error bars and fit a function to it
#
from ROOT import gStyle, TCanvas, TGraphErrors
from array import array
gStyle.SetOptFit (111) # superimpose fit results
c1=TCanvas("c1" ,"Data" ,200 ,10 ,700 ,500) #make nice
c1.SetGrid ()

Comparing the C++ and Python versions in these two examples, it now should be
clear how easy it is to convert any ROOT Macro in C++ to a Python version.

As another example, let us revisit macro3 from Chapter 4. A straight-forward
Python version relying on the ROOT class `TMath`:

{% highlight python %}
# Builds a polar graph in a square Canvas.

from ROOT import TGraphPolar, TCanvas, TMath
from array import array

c = TCanvas("myCanvas","myCanvas",600,600)
rmin = 0.
rmax = TMath.Pi()*6.
npoints = 300
r = array('d',[0]*npoints)
theta  = array('d',[0]*npoints)
for ipt in xrange(0,npoints):
    r[ipt] = ipt*(rmax-rmin)/npoints+rmin
    theta[ipt] = TMath.Sin(r[ipt])

grP1 = TGraphPolar(npoints,r,theta)
grP1.SetTitle("A Fan")
grP1.SetLineWidth(3)
grP1.SetLineColor(2)
grP1.DrawClone("L")
raw_input("Press enter to exit.")
{% endhighlight %}

***More Python- less C++***

You may have noticed already that there are some Python modules providing
functionality similar to ROOT classes, which fit more seamlessly into your
Python code.

A more “pythonic” version of the above macro3 would use a replacement of the
ROOT class TMath for the provisioning of data to TGraphPolar. With the math
package, the part of the code becomes

{% highlight python %}
import math
from array import array
from ROOT import TCanvas , TGraphPolar
...
ipt=range(0,npoints)
r=array('d',map(lambda x: x*(rmax-rmin)/(npoints-1.)+rmin,ipt))
theta=array('d',map(math.sin,r))
e=array('d',npoints*[0.])
...

{% endhighlight %}

***Customised Binning***
This example combines comfortable handling of arrays in Python to define
variable bin sizes of a ROOT histogram. All we need to know is the interface
of the relevant ROOT class and its methods (from the ROOT documentation):

{% highlight C++ %}
TH1F(const char* name , const char* title , Int_t nbinsx , const Double_t* xbins)
{% endhighlight %}

Here is the Python code:

{% highlight python %}
import ROOT
from array import array
arrBins = array('d' ,(1 ,4 ,9 ,16) ) # array of bin edges
histo = ROOT.TH1F("hist", "hist", len(arrBins)-1, arrBins)
# fill it with equally spaced numbers
for i in range (1 ,16) :
   histo.Fill(i)
histo.Draw ()
{% endhighlight %}

## Custom code: from C++ to Python
The ROOT interpreter and type system offer interesting possibilities when it comes
to JITting of C++ code.
Take for example this header file, containing a class and a function.

{% highlight C++ %}
// file cpp2pythonExample.h
#include "stdio.h"

class A{
public:
 A(int i):m_i(i){}
 int getI() const {return m_i;}
private:
 int m_i=0;
};

void printA(const A& a ){
  printf ("The value of A instance is %i.\n",a.getI());
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
>>> import ROOT
>>> ROOT.gInterpreter.ProcessLine('#include "cpp2pythonExample.h"')
>>> a = ROOT.A(123)
>>> ROOT.printA(a)
The value of A instance is 123.
{% endhighlight %}

This example might seem trivial, but it shows a powerful ROOT feature.
C++ code can be JITted within PyROOT and the entities defined in C++ can be
transparently used in Python!# Concluding Remarks

This is the end of our guided tour for beginners through ROOT. There is
still a lot coming to mind to be said, but by now you are experienced
enough to use the ROOT documentation, most importantly the **[ROOT home
page](http://root.cern.ch){:target="_blank"}** and the **[ROOT reference
guide](https://root.cern/doc/master/){:target="_blank"}** with the
documentation of all ROOT classes.

A very useful way for you to continue exploring ROOT is to study the
examples in the sub-directory `tutorials/` of any ROOT installation.

There are some powerful features of ROOT which were not treated in this
document, e.g. packages named RooFit and RooStats providing an advanced
framework for model building, fitting and statistical analysis. The ROOT
namespace `TMVA` offers multi-variate analysis tools including an artificial
neural network and many other advanced tools for classification
problems. The remarkable ability of ROOT to handle large data volumes
was already mentioned in this guide, implemented through the class
`TTree`. But there is still much more for you to explore!

**End of this guide ... but hopefully not of your interaction with ROOT !**
