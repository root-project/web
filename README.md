# New ROOT Web Site Prototype

A working version of this prototype can be seen here: https://root.s3-website.cern.ch

This new web site is based on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

It uses the ["Minimal-Mistakes" theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

The ROOT website uses [its own version of this theme](https://github.com/root-project/minimal-mistakes)

## Testing changes to the website

Pull requests from branches in the root-project/web repo itself are deployed at https://root.s3-website.cern.ch/<prnumber>. Pull requests from forks of this repository will not be deployed.
