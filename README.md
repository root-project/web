# New ROOT Web Site Prototype

A working version of this prototype can be seen here:

  https://root-project.github.io

(or https://root.s3-website.cern.ch)

This new web site is based on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

It uses the ["Minimal-Mistakes" theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

The ROOT website uses [its own version of this theme](https://github.com/root-project/minimal-mistakes)
