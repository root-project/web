The current ROOT logos and icons were developed by Noël Ströhmer in 2014.
The aim was to have a series of simple and clean logos easy to use in web-sites,
web-sites banners, presentations, and even fav-icon.

All the various logos and banners in various sizes and formats can be found [here](/assets/images/logos/).
