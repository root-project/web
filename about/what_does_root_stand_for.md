To answer this question the best is to quote René Brun, one of the project founders of ROOT,
who gave this answer in 1996 in the ROOT mailing list:

_At the start of the project in January 1995, I came quickly to the name
ROOT for our system. The intention to move towards Object Oriented
Technology was already well accepted at this time. It was clear to us
that a basic framework providing at least the services we had in the
past with CERNLIB was necessary before moving to higher level applications.
ROOT really means the "roots" for end-user applications.
Once we have the roots well installed in the ground, Trees or other
Flowers can flourish. We hope that we are reaching this stage now_.

_A possible acronym for the system could be:_
_"Rapid Object-Oriented Technology"_
