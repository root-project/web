To answer this question the best is to quote {% include person_url name="René Brun" %}
, one of the project founders of ROOT, who gave this answer in 1996 in the ROOT mailing list:

_At the start of the project in January 1995, I came quickly to the name
ROOT for our system. The intention to move towards Object Oriented
Technology was already well accepted at this time. It was clear to us
that a basic framework providing at least the services we had in the
past with CERNLIB was necessary before moving to higher level applications.
ROOT really means the "roots" for end-user applications.
Once we have the roots well installed in the ground, Trees or other
Flowers can flourish. We hope that we are reaching this stage now_.

_A possible acronym for the system could be:_
_"Rapid Object-Oriented Technology"_

To learn more on the early history of ROOT, check out the [1997 webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/19970225042027/http://root.cern.ch/) and [Fons' talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/contributions/6733941/attachments/3175370/5646799/30%20Years%20of%20ROOT.pdf) at the [2025 ROOT Users Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505384/timetable/#20251117.detailed).


_Just like trees and plants, applications need strong roots to grow and flower. ROOT is a comprehensive object oriented framework that provides a solid foundation on which large scale data analysis applications can be built_.
