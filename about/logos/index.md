The current ROOT logos and icons were developed by Noël Ströhmer in 2014.
The aim was to have a serie of simple and clean logos easy to use in web-sites,
web-sites banners, presentations, and even fav-icon.

All the various logos and banners in various sizes and formats can be found [here](https://root.cern/img/logos/ROOT_Logo/)
