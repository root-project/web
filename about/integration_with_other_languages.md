ROOT is written in C++ but is integrated with other languages such as Python and R and.

## Python
The Python bindings are also commonly called PyROOT. PyROOT is indeed a Python
extension module that allows the user to interact with any ROOT class from the Python
interpreter. This is done generically using the ROOT dictionary, therefore there is no
need to generate any Python wrapper code to include new ROOT classes. At the same time
PyROOT offers the possibility to execute and evaluate any Python command or start a
Python shell from the ROOT/Cling prompt. Further details are available in the
[PyROOT manual]({{ "/manual/python" | relative_url }}). One of the most powerful features
of PyROOT is that bindings are created automatically for every entity present in the
ROOT type system. In other words, even if a header is interpreted at runtime, Python
bindings will be created automatically.

## R
The interface to R, ROOT R, is an interface allowing to call R functions using an R
C++ interface. It allows to translate some datatypes from C++ to R inside the R
environment and vice versa in an easy way to get the most from both R and ROOT.
With this tool, the user cam tacke advantage of any existing library or R package.
ROOT R also provides a R events processing system, which allows to use the R graphical
system from C++.
