The following people have been working on ROOT for some time in their career and ROOT
would not be what it is without their contributions:

#### Andrei Gheata

Andrei works since 2001 in the offline group of the ALICE experiment. He is an
experimental nuclear physicist who worked before ALICE on data analysis for heavy-ion
experiments in emulsions. In 2000 he started collaborating with the ROOT project and
implemented the TreeViewer interface. Andrei is the main developer of the ROOT geometry
package. He integrated the geometry in the Virtual Monte Carlo framework by developing
interfaces for the GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA particle transport engines.

#### Anna Kreshuk

Anna was a project associate and contributed to different parts of ROOT, most notably to
the fitting machinery, the interface to FFTW, numerous math-related functions,
TEntryList container and PROOF GUI.

#### David Gonzalez Maline

David has been working on improving the performance and correctness of various
mathematical algorithms as well as on integrating AI methods for data analysis inside
the framework. He has also worked on extending and improving the FitPanel interface.

#### Diego Marcos Segura

Diego worked as technical student on CINT dictionary optimizations.

#### Eddy Offermann

Eddy joined the ROOT team during a sabbatical to work on making the ROOT matrix package
the fastest and most versatile in the industry.

#### Ilka Antcheva

Ilka has been working from 2002 to 2008 in the ROOT team. She was responsible for the
GUI system and designed many high level user interfaces and widgets, like found in
many modern graphics applications: ROOT graphics editor (GED) and various object
editors, Fit Panel, Style manager, a tool for automatic C++ code generation of any
widget and the capability for widgets to save themselves. In addition Ilka took care
of the ROOT Users Guide and contributed the chapter ‘Writing a Graphical User
Interface’.

#### Gerardo Ganis

Gerri was a team member for more than ten years; among many other contributions he was
in charge of PROOF for many years.

#### Jan Iwaszkiewicz

Jan was working in the context of a Ph.D. on scheduling and load-balancing of distributed
processing in the Parallel ROOT Facility (PROOF).

#### Leandro Franco

Leo worked a Marie-Curie fellow in the ROOT team from 2005-2008\. He worked on a number
of widely different topics, from parallel sockets, I/O read-ahead, CINT dictionary, etc.

#### Maarten Ballintijn

Maarten's initial dab into ROOT was porting it to Linux in 1995\. Later he worked on the
PROOF system, bringing into production for the RHIC experiments in Brookhaven.

#### Marek Biskup

Marek worked as technical student on various aspects of PROOF, notably integrating the
TChain::Draw() command into PROOF.

#### Masaharu Goto

Masa is the father of CINT. Without the indefatigable support by Masa we would never
have succeeded with the tight integration of CINT in ROOT. Masa is now managing a large
division in Agilent and cannot spend as much time on CINT as he would like.

#### Matevž Tadel

Matevž Tadel is the main developer of 3D graphics and event-visualization packages. He
holds a Ph.D. in experimental high-energy physics, obtained in 2001 for his work on
electron reconstruction in the ATLAS experiment. Before joining the ROOT team in 2005,
he worked on Gled - an advanced ROOT-based system for distributed computing and dynamic
visualisation.

#### Nenad Buncic

Nenad was one of the first people joining the initial ROOT team in 1996\. He developed
the first version of the HTML documentation system (THtml) and worked on the first
version of the 3D graphics system. Nenad left in 1997.

#### Paul Russo

Paul joined the ROOT team at Fermilab in 2005 and has been focusing on support and
developing CINT.

#### Pere Mato

Pere Mato was the project leader from 2014 to 2017. He was the driving force behind
ROOT's migration to CMake and has contributed to PyROOT.

#### Richard Maunder

Richard worked as project associate on the 3D graphics OpenGL based system.

#### Susan Panacek

Susan wrote the first ROOT User's Guide and developed a number of ROOT tutorials.

#### Timur Pocheptsov

Timur worked as a project associate on many different aspects of ROOT, but mostly on the
OpenGL accelerated 3D graphics and the native macOS Cocoa based GUI. Timur also ported
ROOT to the iPad. He continues to maintain the OpenGL and Cocoa code till this day.

#### Valeri Fine

Valeri was a member of the ROOT team from 1998-2000\. He made the initial port to
Windows. Currently he is the maintainer of the ROOT-Qt interface.

#### Valeri Onuchin

Valeri worked as a project associate on many different aspects of ROOT, but mostly in
the GUI and graphics area. He did develop the signal/slot functionality and the GUI
builder. He also developed the Carrot ROOT enabled web server.
