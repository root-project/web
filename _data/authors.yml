René Brun:
  name        : "René Brun"
  bio         : "René, a lifetime developer of ROOT. He joined CERN in 1973. While working
                 with C. Rubbia at the ISR he developped the HBOOK package still in use
                 today. In 1975 he followed Rubbia in the NA4 deep inelastic muon
                 scattering experiment at the SPS where he was in charge of the simulation
                 and reconstruction software and where GEANT1 and GEANT2 were created. In
                 1981, he joined OPAL at LEP, creating the GEANT3 detector simulation
                 system, also pioneering the introduction of the first workstations like
                 Apollos in Europe. In 1984 he coordinated the development of the PAW
                 (Physics Analysis Workstation) data analysis system. Until 1994 he was
                 in charge of the Application Software group in the computing division. In
                 1995, at a time when the majority of software gurus had decided to follow
                 a dead-end line, he created the ROOT system while working for the NA49
                 heavy ion experiment at the SPS. Rene has led the ROOT project from
                 1995-2010."

  bio         : "Fons received his Ph.D. in particle physics from the Univ. of Amsterdam
                in 1991 for his work on event displays and data analysis for the DELPHI
                experiment at CERN's LEP collider. Since then he has worked at CERN and
                been involved in designing and developing data analysis programs. In 1991
                he joined the PAW project where he developed the column wise-ntuples (a
                column-oriented storage system) and PIAF, a parallel data analysis system.
                In 1995, while working as Linux evangelist for Hewlett-Packard at CERN, he
                started with Rene Brun the ROOT project and has been involved in all
                aspects of the system since then. In 2001 Fons joined the ALICE
                collaboration and has worked as software architect on the initial version
                of the AliRoot framework. In recent years his special attention has gone
                to high performance parallel computing using PROOF. Fons took over from
                Rene Brun as ROOT project leader in 2011 and has led the project till
                2014, culminating in the release of ROOT 6."

                 Nijmegen, The Netherlands. They sent him to Fermilab at Chicago, where he
                 worked with the DØ experiment - which also meant writing software from PCI
                 drivers to data analysis code. During that time he got involved with ROOT,
                 converting from a user to a developer. He contributed to whatever he
                 needed, e.g. the statistics part, the documentation engine, and porting it
                 to cygwin. After a position with the Fermilab Computing Division in 2005
                 he ended up at CERN in the ROOT development team. Axel is leading the ROOT
