René Brun:
  name        : "René Brun"
  bio         : "René, a lifetime developer of ROOT. He joined CERN in 1973. While working
                 with C. Rubbia at the ISR he developed the HBOOK package still in use
                 today. In 1975 he followed Rubbia in the NA4 deep inelastic muon
                 scattering experiment at the SPS where he was in charge of the simulation
                 and reconstruction software and where GEANT1 and GEANT2 were created. In
                 1981, he joined OPAL at LEP, creating the GEANT3 detector simulation
                 system, also pioneering the introduction of the first workstations like
                 Apollos in Europe. In 1984 he coordinated the development of the PAW
                 (Physics Analysis Workstation) data analysis system. Until 1994 he was
                 in charge of the Application Software group in the computing division. In
                 1995, at a time when the majority of software gurus had decided to follow
                 a dead-end line, he created the ROOT system while working for the NA49
                 heavy ion experiment at the SPS. Rene has led the ROOT project from
                 1995-2010."

                experiment at CERN's LEP collider. Since then he has worked at CERN and
                been involved in designing and developing data analysis programs. In 1991
                he joined the PAW project where he developed the column wise-ntuples (a
                column-oriented storage system) and PIAF, a parallel data analysis system.
                In 1995, while working as Linux evangelist for Hewlett-Packard at CERN, he
                started with Rene Brun the ROOT project and has been involved in all
                aspects of the system since then. In 2001 Fons joined the ALICE
                collaboration and has worked as software architect on the initial version
                of the AliRoot framework. In recent years his special attention has gone
                to high performance parallel computing using PROOF. Fons took over from
                Rene Brun as ROOT project leader in 2011 and has led the project till
                2014, culminating in the release of ROOT 6."

                 moved to the São Paulo campus for the course of molecular sciences, a
                 special interdisciplinary program of the university aimed at preparing
                 students for scientific research. In 2004, he moved to Japan for his
                 master degree in nuclear physics at the University of Tokyo, where he
                 studied the elastic and inelastic scattering of ⁷Be+p. He then moved on
                 to obtain his PhD in aerospace engineering from the University of
                 Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. Guilherme then worked for two years
                 at São Paulo State University (UNESP) in collaboration with CERN and
                 Fermilab before joining the ROOT Team in April of 2017. His
                 responsibilities in ROOT include working on the build system, performance
                 analysis and optimization, and support for SIMD vectorization."
