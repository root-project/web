On behalf of the developers, contributors and user community: <strong>welcome to ROOT!</strong>

The [ROOT beginners' guide (aka "Primer")]({{ '/Primer' | relative_url }}) 
is certainly the first document to read to master the power of ROOT.
After this introduction, 
[these slides (and video!)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/395198) offer a different, more direct approach to the ROOT fundamental 
concepts as well as some hands-on exercise. In order to integrate the information present 
in the aforementioned sources, [these resources](Courses) 
are definitively useful. Once the fundamental concepts have been acquired, a rich set of 
code examples can be found [here](Code_Examples).

Remember, you can always resort to the 
[ROOT Forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch)
to find out if someone already solved the problem you are facing or to get help!
